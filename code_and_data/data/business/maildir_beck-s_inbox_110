Tom Gros tells me that he has submitted a bid for CL and that it is most
likely his bid will be the winning one.

We have not done anything for a number of reasons, but one is that everyone
at Enron continues to tell us that nothing has happened here and that we
have plenty of time.

I have asked Mike Bridges to look into this for me (he is supposed to be
our commercial contact), but he seems to know little.

Can you find out what is going on ?  I am going to be highly disappointed
if this thing has slipped out from underneath us.
