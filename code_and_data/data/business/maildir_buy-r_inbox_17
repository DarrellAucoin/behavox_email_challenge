Subject: Draft Revised DASH Template
X-FileName: richard buy 1-30-02..pst

All,

Attached is a draft of a revised DASH template to better reflect some of the considerations required for asset divestitures in light of Enron's Chapter 11 status.  Please let me know if you have any comments; after any comments have been incorporated, we will plan to use this as the DASH template going forward.

Thanks and regards,

Dave
