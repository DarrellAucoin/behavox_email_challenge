Connie:

As you begin to tie down the assumptions on the various models, I would like 
to conduct "model reviews" like we used to do in EI.  A single meeting where 
the commercial people responsible for the business and relevant functional 
people all gather with you and I (I would also suggest Rick Buy attend) to 
review the model and the key assumptions.  The goal is less of a "police" 
function and more of an education process to increase understanding of the 
business.

Also, I think I am going to want someone dedicated to reviewing the work on 
the Dabhol model as we consider various renegotiation scenarios.  The 
decision making is too important to not have oversight.

Lastly, have you reviewed the modeling (both in ESA and at RAC) done on 
Cuiaba in connection with the recent board presentation?
