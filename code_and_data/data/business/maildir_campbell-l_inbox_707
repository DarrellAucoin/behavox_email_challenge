At 1400 the ISO requested two Roseton units Out of Merit for ISO
security.  The Limiting Constraints display under the operational
notices lists no security considerations north of the Con Ed Cable
Interface except Oswego - Volney.  How does taking Roseton #1 & #2 Out
of Merit alleviate these constraints.
