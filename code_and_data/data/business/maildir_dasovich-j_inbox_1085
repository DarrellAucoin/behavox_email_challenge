I received a notice through Janet that if we don't pay $100k to California PUC by 12/26/01 our EEMC registration is suspended.  THIS MEANS THAT THE MONEY MUST BE THERE TOMORROW.  Suspension includes ceasing serving residential and small commercial (all accounts below 20kw) within 48 hours.

I think that we've already paid, but Jeff is checking.  

If not, Wade please arrange payment to 

Howard Shyrock
Energy Division - 4th Floor
CPUC
505 Van Ness Avenue
SF, CA 94102

Thanks.
