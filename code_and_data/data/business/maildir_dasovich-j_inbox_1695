Re:        Letter to Governor Davis asking him to consider CMTA's proposals 

CMTA released at both the Governor's Economic Summit and an Assembly 
informational hearing last week its three proposals that will empower 
manufacturers to grow and create new jobs. 

Please go to: <http://www.cmta.net/turning_california_around/index.shtml> 
to see the proposals and download a sample letter to send to Governor 
Gray Davis and your local legislator, asking them to seriously consider 
these investments in California that will keep and grow jobs and produce 
more revenue for the state.  Also fax us a copy of your letter at 916-447-9401 
or e-mail at gdicaro@cmta.net <mailto:gdicaro@cmta.net>. 

We need as many letters as possible, so please pass along. 

Thank You.
