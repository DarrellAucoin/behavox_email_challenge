Attached is the revised and substantially complete Petition for Review.  I would like comment by the end of the day on Tuesday so that the Petition can be placed in final form.

The revised application for stay will be sent on Monday, together with the revised supporting declaration.

I understand Douglass is working on the application for rehearing and I will coordinate with him so it includes the additional material necessary for the record (for example, the commerce clause argument and hardship/irreparable harm).  EWD
