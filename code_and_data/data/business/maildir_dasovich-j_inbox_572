Jeff,

My colleague Joel Schwartz and I are looking for a concise summary of
the typical siting/permitting process for a plant in California,
including steps in the process, number of agencies, and average length.
Any ideas?

Thanks again for your great remarks last Friday; I really appreciated
them.

Regards, Lynne
