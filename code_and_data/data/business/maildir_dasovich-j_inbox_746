Hi Jeff -  Throughput to Blythe has been averaging about 84% this year with peak flows of 99% in Jan and March.  In your sentence below, do you mean to ensure max vols through Blythe?  Typically, Topock averages higher throughput than Blythe.  Thanks for your help.

Talked to someone at the PUC (and I'll be talking to additional folks over there).  Question:  Do we know what volumes through Blythe have been?  One thing that might be happening is that SoCal's restricting flows at Topock in order to ensure minimum volumes through Blythe.

Best,
Jeff
