Subject: Additional Information Regarding CLEC Issue
X-FileName: jdasovic.nsf

Hello Everyone,

Scott and I recently met with the DC law firm of Swidler, Berlin as part of 
the on-going discussions around forming a CLEC.  We asked for an analysis 
that looks at a couple of our products in a sampling of states to see if they 
would, in fact, trigger the requirement that we form a CLEC.  Swidler, Berlin 
produced the attached memo which looks at Florida, Illinois and New York.  I 
think you will find the information in the memo to be very consistent with 
Scott and Donald's previous analysis of this issue.  We'll keep you posted as 
the discussion goes on (and on and on).

Sue
