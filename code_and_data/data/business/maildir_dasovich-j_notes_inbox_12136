Subject: Streaming programs
X-FileName: jdasovic.nsf

Are any of you aware of any customer choice programs (preferably gas) that 
are of the "streaming" variety, that is, the utility purchases a particular 
package of gas for a customer and the customer pays the price for that 
particular package rather than the WACOG.  This type of program would be used 
where direct access has not been adopted.  I need to know for a data request 
in a Southwest Gas gas ASAP.  Thanks.
