Jeff:

FYI, we had an instructive rest of the conference call on Friday with
Sue and Robbie et al.
They indicated they could use Steve's help face to face at some point.

We are following up with Sue and Robbie on a couple legal issues, case
law and MSA self-certification language, and let me know if you have
additional items.

We await approval on the final tariff language and can then file at the
CPUC.  Let me know what schedule works for you.
Also, can you confirm the correct names, email addresses, titles for
those new folks on Friday's call: Robbie Rossi, Michelle, Melissa Lloyd?

Thanks.
