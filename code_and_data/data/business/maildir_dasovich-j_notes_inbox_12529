Interesting new perspective.  By imposing Environmental Dispatch on plants
operating extra hours over their air quality permits, the scope of the bill
actually becomes broader than just RMR units.   Enron's new plants could
well be some of the cleanest plants, and have an advantage, but this bill
would also apply mainly to older plants that have air district limits on
their ability to run, and environmental dispatch of those plants could
change the market for power by eliminating ecnomomic rank ordering of
dispatch in the marketplace, and give the ISO a greater hand in dispatching
generation.  I think we need to ask the traders about this ASAP.  My guess
is that they will not like it.  Mike Day
