The PUC has released the PD of ALJ Wong which proposes to alter the CPUC
education program for electric restructuring.  It proposes to take the
budget for the education program and spend it all on conervation messages,
and to drop the current program elements which advise consumers that direct
access is available to them.    This is a bit short sighted as direct access
ca reduce state financial impacts of the high-priced market.  However, I
suspect we do not want to get into this fight, and wouldn't want to expand
retail residential service yet anyway, but I thought I would ask.  Mike
