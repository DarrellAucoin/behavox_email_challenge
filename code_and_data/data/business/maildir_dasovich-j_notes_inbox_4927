Heather will try to get you the stuff you want.  FYI, if you tell us
in advance of the meeting we can be sure to get the draft orders for you in
the Escutia room.  We do not generally get all the orders unless an attorney
or client has indicated an interest in the item.  So when we get close to a
commission meeting, give us (or Heather) a buzz and ask for what you are
tracking.  Mike
