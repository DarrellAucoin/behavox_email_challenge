Mark, Ron, Alaadin and Hollis: 

I am uncomfortable, extremely uncomfortable, with trying to make this test 
pass by using data that is not synchronized within the same period of the 
test as the remaining turbines. This is not in keeping with the spirt of the 
test. It is clear that we did not pass the ATP even this second time and that 
the cause of our failure is the failure of the Omnitron's to provide us with 
reliable data. 

I wish to point this out in my weekly SCADA report to add futher backbone to 
our need to replace the Omnitron switches with Hirschmann's. 

Lets not spend any more effort on this particular test, but wait until we 
have the Hirschmann's installed. I will speak with O&M and with our customer 
about this problem. 

Regards 

KLC
