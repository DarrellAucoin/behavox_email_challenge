Hollis - 

Per the phone conversation earlier today, below is a chart exhibiting the 
differences between the Monthly Operational Report (Mark Fisher) and the 
Weekly MTD (John Ruiz) numbers posted on the web.  Both cases should include 
the numbers through the end of the month.  From what we discussed, my 
understanding is that the chart should pool from the same source.  Please let 
me know if I am viewing this information incorrectly.

Thanks,
Ilan
