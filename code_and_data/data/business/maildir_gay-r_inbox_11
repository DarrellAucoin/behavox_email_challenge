Subject: FUNDIES MEETING EVERY DAY BEGINNING NEXT WEEK
X-FileName: rgay (Non-Privileged).pst

For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.
