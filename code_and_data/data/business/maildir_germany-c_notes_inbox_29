Hey guys,

I am starting to look a little closer at the sythetic storage and actual 
storage deals being done on the Southeast.

I am capturing the sitara deals and their pricing in order to get a better 
understanding of how sythetic and actual deals are priced differently.

I am also taking a look at how we are pathing this activity in Unify.  In 
order to avoid rework for the schedulers, I have been verifying our pathing 
procedures with Donna Greif (Unify guru) prior to pathing.

As more storage deals are done, I will be sure to distribute any new 
information to you all.

Please feel free to add any helpful hints to my spreadsheets.



Thanks
Trish
