Group,

I have created some new procedures for the SAR, CARP, and Enpower to CAPS  
mainly to make it easier for the newer members of the group to run the 
reports at night. They are fairly detailed and are tested once but I would 
appreciate any further feedback from you.

These procedures are located in P: /Real Time/ Reports

hope this helps,
Monika
