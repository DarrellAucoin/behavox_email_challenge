It is my understanding that:
After taking into account the recent preferred with Dynegy, Enron has limited authorized shares for further private equity; 
A shareholders meeting is necessary to authorize additional shares; and
A shareholders meeting requires a 30-day notice period.

In order to be safe, I think we need an additional 250 million authorized shares - in order to comfortably raise up to $2.0+ billion - although the first tranche will likely be $800 to $900 million.

Who is the right person to take the lead in this matter?
