Frank, 
     Sequent is extremely interested in an early termination of the Enron/AGLES contract covering the asset management of the VNG.
We are in the process of evaluating a proposal to Enron and hope to have something to you shortly.  I will keep in touch.  Thanks
 
Dana Grams

Dana, I wanted to follow up on our conversation of last week relative to
my proposal e-mailed to you on 10/22/01.  We are in the process of
considering several term transactions that could be supported by the VNG
assets.  Given your previous interest in terminating the Gas Supply
Assignment and Agency Agreement early I wanted to ask if you still have
that interest.  If we complete any of the transactions being considered
it will become more difficult to cleanly terminate the Agreement and
return the assets to you without you taking on the obligations within
such agreement.  It sounded to me last week as if you were no longer
focused on the early termination for the reasons that you outlined.  We
understood your request to look at this opportunity and we responded
with our 10/22/01 proposal.  Can you tell me if your interest has
changed ?  I want to remain focused on this if you are interest, if
things have changed I want to move on in another direction.

Frank
