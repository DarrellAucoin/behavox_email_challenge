Subject: MERCATOR ENERGY INCORPORATED and ENERGY WEST INCORPORATED
X-FileName: TJONES (Non-Privileged).pst

Please check your records and let me know if you have any kind of documentation evidencing a merger indicating that Mercator Energy Incorporated merged with and into Energy West Incorporated?
 
I am unable to find anything to substantiate this information.
 
Thanks for your help.
