Dale, could you please forward to John and me a copy of the EOL U.S. weather 
derivatives GTCs and long descriptions for swaps and options so that they can 
be looked at for Japan?

By way of background, the traders in Japan (Jonathan Whitehead, Morten-Erik 
Pettersen) want to start offering EOL weather derivatives (swaps and options) 
through Enron Japan Corp. in lieu of Enron Australia as the Enron 
counterparty, beginning the end of August 2000.

Regards, Alan

Alan-

As we will need to change the Enron counterparty for Japanese weather to 
Enron Japan Corp. (on EOL), please have the US GTC's forwarded to me, so that 
I can begin the process of amending same to conform to Japanese 
law/practice.   I believe this will be better than attempting to modify the 
Australian GTC's.

Thanks,

John
