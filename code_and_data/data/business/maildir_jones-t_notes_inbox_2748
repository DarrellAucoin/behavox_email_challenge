I do not know if you are aware of the following projects that utilize total 
return swaps:

Project Catalytica
Project Avici
Project Inga
Project Cerberus
Project Hawaii 125-I
Project Hawaii 125-II
Project Tahiti


Another transaction in which we have be requested to provide a commodity swap 
is East Coast Power.  The swap will be with some El Paso party with a El Paso 
Energy Corporation.

Let me know what else you may want to know about any of this.
