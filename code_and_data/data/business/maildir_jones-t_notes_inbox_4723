Jake -

To avoid a battle of the forms, I have reviewed the Cargill NDA.  I have 
noted Enron's comments within this document.  Please forward and have Cargill 
contact me directly with any questions or comments.

I will be out of the office tomorrow and Friday, but will be checking my 
e-mails periodically.  Also, Tana will know how to contact me if necessary.
