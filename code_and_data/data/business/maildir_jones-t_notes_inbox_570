Team,

We have an incoming guaranty from Formosa Plastics Corporation, USA, covering 
its subsidiary, Neumin Production Company, for $15MM.  We would like to amend 
this amount to an unlimited amount.  Unfortunately, miscommunication between 
Fred's group and mine has led to a situation where the counterparty is 
expecting this tomorrow.  Is it possible to get this drafted today, 
signed-off by one of our attorneys and sent to the CP?  If not, I will need 
to get with Fred (which I would rather avoid) and then probably the CP.  

Sorry for the rush, and if it can't be done today, I understand.  Either way, 
please coordinate with me on whether or not it is going out.

Thanks again,

John
