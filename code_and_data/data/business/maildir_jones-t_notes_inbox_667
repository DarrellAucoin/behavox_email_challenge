To All:

Please see the attached credit worksheet for Cinergy Marketing & Trading.  It 
seems we may have sent a draft out under Producers Energy before they were 
acquired by Cinergy, although a new draft should be sent out.

Oh and by the way you will be happy to know I included the ESP numebrs this 
time.

Thank you,

Russell
