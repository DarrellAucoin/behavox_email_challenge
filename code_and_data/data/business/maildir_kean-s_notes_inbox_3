Steve --  A few months ago, Erin Rice approached me about the idea of 
creating a Chief Morale Officer for Enron, a relatively new concept she had 
read about.   I asked her to write up a position description (attached).  
Last week, Meredith and I attended a media conference in San Francisco with 
all the top new media and traditional business/financial publications, and 
the big story trend is corporate culture and what's new and different at 
companies.  A CMO would give Enron a unique angle to participate in (and 
pitch) culture stories and increase our exposure (and help with recruiting).  
It would also serve an incredible need internally to have an executive who 
was responsive, accessible to employees and had the ability to resolve 
problems.  In looking at the organization, I thought someone like Cindy Olson 
would be perfect for a CMO.  Just wanted to pass along this suggestion to see 
what you thought.

Thanks.
