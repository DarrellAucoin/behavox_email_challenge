Any way to commercially prevent this from happening? Phone calls, etc.

FYI - The net OTC for 10/29/01 is $73MM out.  The big player is Reliant getting $79MM returned as they are putting up a letter of credit.  Also, we have a first in that Sempra Energy is calling ERAC (Enron Reserve Acquisition Corporation) for $41MM of margin for crude.  Call with any questions.
