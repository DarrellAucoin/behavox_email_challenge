Subject:	Update on FERC ANOPR on Generator Interconnection Procedures

Last week's meetings in FERC's Generator Interconnection Procedures proceeding focused primarily on queuing issues.  A summary of the meetings is attached; the summary describes the meetings in some detail and lists interests articulated by the various parties.  

At the conclusion of the meetings:

 	- The generators and the transmission owners were still fairly far apart on several important issues pertaining to queuing:

		* what should be included in the base case study
		* milestones and their impacts
		* consequences of project cancellation
		* use of a preliminary feasibility ("fatal flaw") study
		* generator liability for upgrades

	- A committee of various participants issued a draft document on interconnection products and studies.  This document is attached.  The document recommends that three different types of interconnection service be available:  1) Energy Resource service, which allows use of existing capacity on an "as available" basis, 2) Network Resource service, which integrates the generator's facility as a qualified network resource in a manner comparable to native load customers, and 3) optional interconnection services, which would include but not be limited to Simple Interconnection Service, which allows physical interconnection but does not provide generator with the ability to synchronize its facility with the transmission owner's system.  Interested parties are to post comments on this document to the Commission's website by Nov. 23, and further issues pertaining to products will be discussed at the next meetings (Nov. 27 - 28).

If you have questions, or if you would like to discuss the attached, please contact me.
