Kay,

Attached is the proposed CA for Western Resources, Inc. that Rudy requested today.  It is identical to the proposed Dynegy CA.

Rudy,  Reagan suggested to use the same form and scope of discussions as the Dynegy CA.  Let Kay and I know if you think there should be any changes.

Thanks.

Kathleen
