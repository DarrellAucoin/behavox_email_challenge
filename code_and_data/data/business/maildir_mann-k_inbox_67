No.  I confirmed with Ed Baughman re: PA and Mike Curry re: TX, and EPMI has no current retail deals in those states.

Janet, 

Do you know if we have any deals in Texas or Penn which might be impacted by a license suspension?  I know that's a tough question.

Kay:

As requested, this draft memo summarizes disclosures that EPMI must make to maintain its retail licenses.  Please let me know if you need more information.
