Ana, 

Per our conversation earlier today:

Our survey shows the tracts we are selling consist of 330.12 acres.  For the purpose of the DASH, we need to have a precise book value for those 330.12 acres, so I need to confirm with you one final time the book value for that land.  

Also, the draft agreement for the land sale stipulates that all ad valorem taxes bearing against the property due and payable through 2000 have been paid.  Before we sign the agreement, we need confirmation from you that this is the case.  

Since we are trying to close this deal tomorrow (11/20), I would appreciate a quick response.  Thanks for your cooperation.
