Gerald, the ILL. atty. Chris Hilgert referred to is Chris Townsend -His number is 312-368-4039. The specific question is: can we utilize Com Ed for E service at Nicor's "Troy Grove" Facility? (Located near Troy Grove, ILL- approx 10 Miles North of the Town of La Salle, ILL) The Com Ed substation we would like to have power delivered at is approx 7 Miles N. of the facility near the town of Mendota, ILL.  

Notes: 1) Nicor does not currently have an ILL Power service drop.(They are totally self gen.) 
           2) We would build line up to Com Ed and buy at the substation.
