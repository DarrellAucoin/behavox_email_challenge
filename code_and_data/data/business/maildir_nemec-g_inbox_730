Gerald,

I know that you have been busy with the Mexicana transaction, but I wanted to see how things were going on your review of the Questar and Sonoran open season docs.  The Questar open season ends tomorrow, May 31 at 5p.  The Sonoran open season closes the following day.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Phil
