Jim,

I understand you are now in charge of the engineering for the Tejas-Texoma 
Interconnect.  Please see the attached agreement for your review.  Please 
give me a call if you have any questions, or we can sit down and go over the 
agreement.  This is a high priority deal.  Thanks for your assistance.
