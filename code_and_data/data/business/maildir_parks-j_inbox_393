Here is the revised draft. I spoke with the Duke attorney and he is
taking "let me see it and I'll let you know" approach so let me know if
you have any additional changes and I will send it over to him.

Also, it is my understanding that we must now have a Weil Gotschal
bankruptcy attorney sign off on the deal
so I am trying to find out who that person is and what needs to be done.
