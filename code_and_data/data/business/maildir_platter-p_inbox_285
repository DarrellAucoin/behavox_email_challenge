X-FileName: phillip platter 6-26-02.PST

ISO Market Participants:
The white paper on the ISO's Uninstructed Deviation Proposal posted last
week on the ISO web site erroneously stated that  negative deviations would
be paid at 75% of MCP.  The actual proposal is to charge negative deviations
125% of MCP.
A revised proposal is posted at
