I talked to my Supervisor and here is what we can do, PNMGS will not accept or confirm any nominations under Off-System Transportation Contract T39817.  This will put the Contract in an "INACTIVE" status instead of total Termination of the Contract.
Prior to any  future expectation of Off-system Transportation, pursuant to Contract T39817 between PNMGS and TWPC, there will then be an updated and current determination on the Financial Responsibility as set forth under ARTICLE XII. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.   PNMGS will then decide what, if any, steps will need to be taken prior to such Off-system Transportation.
