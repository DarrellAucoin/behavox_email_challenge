Lee and Bill, please find attached two SW Gas Proposals from Kim Watson.  Please review for possible signing by Steve Harris on today.  Kim is on vacation but would like for these letters to go out today.

Again, please review and let me know if there are any changes as soon as possible.

Thanks in advance,
