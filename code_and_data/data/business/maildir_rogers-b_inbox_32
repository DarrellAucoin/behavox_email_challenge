$22,000 for O&M??

I am not sure how in the world this can be considered a typical example.
Where are the taxes?
Where are the interest payments?
Return on Investment?

If the objective is to grossly misrepresent the cost of a GT then this
is a typical example.

Attached is a revised presentation from Norman Mah for the Sept. 24 ICAP
Working Group meeting. The presentation is three pages long. The change
made
in this version is on page 2: the "O&M" number has been lowered to
$22,000
from the previous version, in response to comments received by Mr. Mah.
Otherwise, the presentation mirrors the one previously circulated.
