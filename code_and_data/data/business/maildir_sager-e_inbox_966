Monday   -2

The Hall-Yoder Daily Assessment Index for Tuesday, November 20 is  -2.

The bad news contained in the 10Q did not lead to an immediate junk bond downgrade.  This implies that Mr. Banker,  who lent us the  $9b that, (surprise!),  we have to pay back so soon,  has been able to persuade Mr. Credit Rater to stay his release of the raised guillotine a day longer, permitting us, we hope, to withdraw our neck from the block and continue to negotiate with Mr. Banker for the vintage Enron "blend and extend" package. 

Amidst much crow activity up and down the river, a single large specie was seen flying due north with a large tuft of something clasped in his beak,  followed by a rapacious sea gull in hot pursuit.
