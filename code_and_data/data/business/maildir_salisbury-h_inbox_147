Stephen, this lists the obligations that the STSW desk can deliver on for the month of January.  The in the money MW totals are summarized and a market price was used to determine an expected cost to satisfy these obligations.  These costs assumed that the purchase obligation was incurred for the calendar month of January 02 at todays market price.  If you have any questions please contact myself or Tom Alonso.
