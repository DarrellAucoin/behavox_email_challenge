Hey Guys - Well, I had to learn some Cod Scheduling fast this afternoon, (we really do need to exchange new cell phone numbers :-)). Anyway, tag #40700 was incorrect and BPA called about 3:45.  I cancelled that tag and replaced it with tag #40716
I hope what I did was okay, let me know if I should have done it differently.  On the NW sheet that tag number is highlighted in yellow in case there is a problem.  I assume the something needs to be corrected in the preschedule workspace, but I don't know what it is, so I will leave it to Cara or Donald to explain it to me in the morning.  Thanks again, Serena
