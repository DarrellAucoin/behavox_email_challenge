I have not seen the notice, but it would relate to a coal makrketing agency agreement between Anker and ENA, as agent.

Could you have forwarded to me.

A termination notice of the foregoing agreement was sent to your attention.  Do you know what this agreement is?  Could it be related to Enron Credit Limited (which had a position in Anker paper)?
