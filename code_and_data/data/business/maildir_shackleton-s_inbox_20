The defined terms in the EEI Master and other Master Agreements on the Power side are generic so probably good to have them included and this still enables us to maintain a generic form.
In the older Master Agreements the only difference is in respect of the relevant Section reference and sometimes "termination Payment" is referred to as "Early Termination Payment".
