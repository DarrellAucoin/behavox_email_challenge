A woman called Elaine Schield (x35476) from Accounting has been calling me over the past week or two about the status of the two NYMEX seats and I told her as soon as we heard what was going to happen to them we would let her know.  She also wanted copies of the "seat documents".  Pursuant to my conversations with you and Mark yesterday, I left her a voicemail telling her it was now our understanding that the seats would stay with the Estate and that she needed to contact you in the future.  I left her your phone number.

I told her that the "evidence" of the seats consisted only of the application and the letter received back from the NYMEX approving the application.  There is no other formal evidence of the seats.  I am going to go ahead and copy the seat applications for her (except for the personal applications of Haedicke and Lavorato since it contains personal information such as bank accounts and the like).  I will generally not provide such personal information to anyone unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.
