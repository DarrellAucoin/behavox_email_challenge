Mary,
Do you have an Enron North America Corp. bank account I can use for Goldman Sachs.  The hedge book is in a grouping of accounts under ENA.  In the past, we have wired to ECT Investments Inc.'s Citibank account but this is probably not a good idea at this time.

The amount is $985,614.39.

Please advise.
Sheila
