Select Energy has requested that a letter be sent to them that outlines specific bank account instructions for specific Enron entities such as:	

	Enron Power Marketing

	Enron North America - Financial Gas

	Enron North America - Physical Gas

They would also like them to be signed by someone in authority over these groups.  The person I have been speaking with at Select is:

	Dott Tucker - Her phone number is 860-665-2836 in case you should have any questions.  

Thanks for your help in this matter.
