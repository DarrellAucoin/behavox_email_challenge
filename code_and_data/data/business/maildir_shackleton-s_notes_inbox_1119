Sara and Sam,
Just to clarify....
We have an existing ECT Investments Executing Broker Agreement with MLPFS and 
do not need an ENA one.
The MLPFS agreement with ECT Investments dates from 1996 and they have 
inactivated on their side.
We do need to update the existing agreement as we have alot of current 
activity with them.  

This is an update and not a new relationship.
Thanks. Sheila
