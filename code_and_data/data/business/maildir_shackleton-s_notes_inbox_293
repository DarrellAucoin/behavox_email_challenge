Sara,
It looks like all the issues have been worked out.  Please review the 
attached language and let me know if it looks o.k. It is not complete with 
trading times, but if you could review it to ensure we have the correct 
Trading Entities, that would be great.

William,

We still need trading times from you.  If you could forward that to me when 
you get a chance.

Thank you,

Melba
