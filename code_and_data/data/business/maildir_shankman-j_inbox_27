In our lunch with Hess the other day, they mentioned a few things of interest regarding EOL.

They would like to be able to see what has traded (like on ICE).
They'd like to be able to put in orders even if our prices are not up.
Keen on the idea of trading settlement and particularly average.
Would like at the end of the month to square up NXC2s.
They still love EOL, they don't even have to write deal tickets for it, it goes straight into their system. Would dearly love 50 lots on gasoil.
Asked if we could go round and optimise EOL for them

Apart from that, didn't express much of a view, seemed to be playing it small on flat price.
