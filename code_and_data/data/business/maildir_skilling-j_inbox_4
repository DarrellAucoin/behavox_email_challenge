Jeff:

I'm sure this is just a "misunderstanding", but I know that UBS Capital has spent innumerable hours with management.  While Mark says that he doesn't want LJM to have an advantage, it looks like LJM is being put at a disadvantage.  You would think that Cliff and Mark would welcome a new bidder with open arms after failing to sell this business for 2+ years.  Until this is resolved, I'll assume that LJM is out of the bidding and will not do any further work.  Enron is back to one bidder (the lower one) -- better for our company ???

Andy - Mark Metts called tonight and has asked me not to meet with you in Houston tomorrow.  His stated concern is over disparate/more favorable treatment of you (LJM) as opposed to other bidders for EWC.  As we have discussed, while I am very interested in an LJM financed MBO, at this stage I need you to sort out any process issues with Cliff/Mark and/or Jeff.  Let's meet as soon as that gets worked out.  In the meantime, I won't travel to Houston Monday but will call to chat.  Thanks. Adam
