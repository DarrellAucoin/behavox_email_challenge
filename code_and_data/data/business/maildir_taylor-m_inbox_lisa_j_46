Subject: New Source Review & Multipollutant Update
X-FileName: MTAYLOR5 (Non-Privileged).pst

You may have seen recent media reports on the topics of possible EPA action=
 on New Source Review (NSR) regulation and multipollutant legislation, so I=
 wanted to summarize some of the important current developments:

New Source Review:

EPA was asked to conduct a 90-day review of NSR and come up with recommenda=
tions for the larger Bush National Energy Plan.   EPA held several public h=
earings and solicited public comments, which closed July 27.   Enron submit=
ted comments (which I sent by e-mail on 7/30/01).   EPA has indicated that =
it will report to the President only on "impacts of NSR on the power sector=
" on August 17 and delay any specific recommendations for NSR reform until =
mid-September.

Stories in the past few days have suggested that EPA's findings will "ease =
emissions standards" on coal utilities. Such characterizations are somewhat=
 slanted, as they are based on information coming from environmental groups=
 who oppose any NSR reform -- but there is some substantive merit behind th=
ese reports as well.

NSR enforcement over plant modifications has been an extremely contentious =
issue for electric utilities, and many industry sources have been lobbying =
hard to relax EPA enforcement policy.  From an administrative perspective, =
this is a relatively easy reform for  EPA to tackle -- it would only requir=
e a change in "guidance" and not a lengthy regulatory process or legislatio=
n.   As you can see from the attached stories, environmental groups are ext=
remely opposed to this type of action, and are using the media very effecti=
vely to put pressure on EPA against such loosening of NSR enforcement stand=
ards.
EPA will likely recommend a number of broader administrative and legislativ=
e changes to NSR, most requiring a longer trip through the legislative or r=
egulatory process.   Such changes could include reforms to BACT/LAER analys=
is for new or existing sources, relief for cleaner sources, or standardizat=
ion of some of the more arbitrary provisions of NSR.   Given the longer-ter=
m effort required, these proposed reforms may be newsworthy, but less likel=
y to have an impact on the power sector in the short-term.

Some of the recent complicating issues have been calls from other industry =
sectors (manufacturers,  refining, industrial boilers, gas pipelines) for N=
SR relief.  EPA would prefer to address power sector issues only, but may b=
e politically forced to make recommendations in other sectors as well.  It =
is not yet clear what sectors or what issues they will address.

Possible Outcomes/Impacts:  Large coal utilities have spent a great deal of=
 resources putting pressure on the Administration on the modification & enf=
orcement issues.  The issue is the easiest short-term solution to offer fro=
m a regulatory standpoint, so despite environmental group opposition, it is=
 likely that EPA will recommend immediate action in this area, along with l=
onger-term reforms.  For Enron businesses this means that coal, emissions a=
nd power trading should expect renewed strength in the coal generation sect=
or, as older assets would face less barriers to extending their life.  Orig=
ination opportunities (plant upgrades, capacity increases) may increase as =
customers fears about enforcement actions subside.  Industrial and gas pipe=
line sectors may see relief in the modification area as well, if EPA decide=
s to tackle sectors outside just power.  Particularly on gas pipeline issue=
s, turbine maintenance issues may be clear-cut enough for EPA to make a sim=
ple , short term recommendation.

Multipollutant Legislation

Also making news lately were statements by EPA Administrator Christine Whit=
man, indicating that EPA plans to release a proposal to scrap existing emis=
sions regulations (NOx SIP Call/126 Rule, Regional Haze, SO2/Acid Rain) for=
 a more streamlined "multipollutant" plan.  Multipollutant strategies have =
been discussed for some time, but are becoming more newsworthy lately becau=
se they were included as possible options under the Bush Energy Plan, and o=
ffer potential solutions to NSR reform problems.

EPA's proposed elimination of existing air programs is not as drastic as it=
 sounds -- in fact, it offers the opportunity to replace confusing, overlap=
ping programs on multiple pollutants that are currently regulated or will s=
oon be regulated by EPA with a more certain and flexible system.  Prospects=
 for development of a multipollutant trading plan that reforms NSR are much=
 less predictable, however, and will require a longer-term legislative effo=
rt.  =20

In September 2001, we expect to see release of EPA's plan, as well as congr=
essional consideration of several pieces of multipollutant legislation.  We=
 are working closely with EPA, the White House, and Congress on these issue=
s and will continue to keep commercial and corporate groups informed on the=
 progress of multipollutant strategies.   Unless political dynamics change =
drastically, we would not expect final action on multipollutant legislation=
 this year.  As the issue evolves, we will be in touch with more specifics =
on the legislation and Enron's strategy.

If you have questions or would like more information, please contact me.
