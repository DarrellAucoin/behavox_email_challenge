The trading season was originally May 1 to Oct 1, however court
delays caused the season to be pushed back to May 31 for all
states.  This change will only take place in the initial 2004 trading
season.  Following years will include the month of May.

Also, I will be out of the office from August 6-17 (Army Reserve
Training) and Joel will be out next week.  Monsoor will be available
to answer questions you may have, but the SIP call is not really
his area.  If you have any questions that you can anticipate now,
you may want to send them this week.

Thanks,
Sara
