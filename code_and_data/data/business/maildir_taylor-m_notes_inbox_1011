Attached is a revised version of the GTCs for Match.  Brandon, let me know if 
I addressed all of your comments appropriately.  I'll proof these again 
tonight.  

On the Financial GTCs (which are attached, but not revised), I think the 
"Market Disruption" provisions are OK, but want to talk to Mark Taylor about 
what the probable lack of a dependable "Floating Price Source" in many 
instances.
