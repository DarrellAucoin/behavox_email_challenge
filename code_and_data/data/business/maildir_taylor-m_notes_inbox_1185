Have you heard of this request yet?  Seth said that he mentioned it to the 
EOL team but was not sure if they had mentioned it to you yet.

Brent, we understand that Tempest, another Bermuda reinsurer, is also 
interested in getting EOL access.  What's the timetable on Bermuda due 
diligence (I know we  discussed this briefly earlier this week)?
