Just a reminder that we have the Customer Access Agreement that Craig Breslau 
sent up for our review.  We need to (1) determine what procedures, if any, we 
need to put in place with respect to user ID's to other online trading 
websites, and (2) respond to Craig about this agreement.  When you both get 
back in town can we set a time to discuss this.  Thanks...
