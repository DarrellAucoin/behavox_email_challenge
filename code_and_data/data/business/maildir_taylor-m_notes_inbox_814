The attached list is divided into two sheets:
Existing EOL counterparties
New counterparties from the MG traders (please note there are a few 
duplicates between the lists - these are marked on the new MG counterparty 
list)

We have heard that the NY MG traders may be adding additional counterparties 
to the list.  We will keep you advised of any changes.

Regards,
Lara
