Subject: Posting Agreement
X-FileName: mtaylor.nsf

Attached is a revised version of the Posting Agreement.  Unfortunately, the 
redline against the version sent to us by S&C shows practically the entire 
agreement as brand new text (instead of showing changes to the old text), so 
it will not be particularly helpful to review a redline.

The changes to S&C's draft are extensive, but most changes are added 
definitions, termination rights, representations and warranties, and the like 
-- the provisions regarding how the platforms work together and how contracts 
are entered into are essentially the same.

Let me know how you want to proceed with your review of this draft -- I'm 
happy to discuss it with you before your review if you want..
