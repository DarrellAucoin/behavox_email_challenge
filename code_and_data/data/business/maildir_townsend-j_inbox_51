January 29, 2002

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE) pipeline system was over scheduled on
the 24 inch system between Longview Compressor Station and Fagus
Compressor Station for Gas Day January 30, 2002. As a result, TE
restricted receipts between Longview and Pollard to the capacity that
may move up the 24-inch system. No intra-day nominations for gas leaving
this area or for additional physical supply will be accepted for gas day
30.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.
