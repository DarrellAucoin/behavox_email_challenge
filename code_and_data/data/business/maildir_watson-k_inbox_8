Planning has conducted flow studies to determine the capacity of WT-2 system with respect to receiving volume from NNG at Halley interconnect. The limiting factors in determining the capacity of this system were the maximum discharge pressure at WT-2 and the average pressure requirements at Valero-Ward pipeline.

WT-2 is able to discharge at a maximum of 1040 psig pressure and the operating pressure range of Valero pipeline in this area is 975-995 psig.
Based on the above conditions WT-2 would be able to deliver only 505 mmcf/d gas to :

Lone-Star Warwink	  30 mmcf/d
Valero Ward		115 mmcf/d
Ovasis			138 mmcf/d
Westar-Ward		 80  mmcf/d 
Valero Pecos		 95  mmcf/d
Lonestar Pecos		 47  mmcf/d
Total			505 mmcf/d

This flow model indicates that ( assuming main line valve-208 B is closed) WT-2 would be able to receive up to 100 mmcf/d from NNG at Halley interconnect.
The remaining gas supply behind Wt-2 would flow from NGPL-Winkler, EOG, Keystone/ Sid Richardson, Monument and WT-1.

Based on the data obtained from our TW-Firm Data Book the existing committed volume at WT-2 for next five months are:

		Aug-01 Sep-01	Oct-01 Nov-01	Dec-01	  
Comitted volume		582  	582	582 	565	545
( mmcf/d)											

505 mmcf/d capacity:							
*** Less USGT at		77	77	77	60	40
     WT-2  	       

***. Option-1: 12 mmcf/d could be handle at WT-1 on Aug-01, 21 mmcf/d on Sep-01, 7 mmcf/d 
                       on Oct-01 and the rest through Texas Panhandle Lateral. Capacity is sold at WT-1 
                       on Nov-01 and Dec-01.
    . Option-2: Or all through Texas Panhandle Lateral.
                                                            
From Jan-02 to Jul-02, capacity is not available at WT-2. Sold at 505 mmcf/d maximum capacity.

Capacity availability at WT-1  from Aug-01 to Jul-02 based on 425 mmcf/d :
	
		Aug-01	Sep-01	Oct-01	Nov-01	Dec-01
Available capacity:		12	21	7	-11	-11	
		Jan-02	Feb-02	Mar-02	Apr-02	May-02
Available capacity:		11	11	26	55	54		
				Jun-01	Jul-01
Available capacity:		67	62

Note: All volumes are in mmcf/d.
