Michelle, I took advantage of the long weekend and wanted to share this good
news with you first because you have been supportive of my digital endeavors.

Color me excited!  My digital waterfall electronic storefront is open for
business.

You may have seen some of the images in the Oregon 2000 vacation report on my
personal web site.

I've placed the best of the lot for viewing and purchase on the new
storefront site.

The address is:  http://nwdigifalls.homestead.com

Come linger awhile.  I think you will enjoy a tour of the gallery.  The
images are magnificent!

Michelle, don't worry about purchasing; just enjoy the views.  I wanted to
show off my web design skills and share these delightful waterfall images
with you.  Click on a thumbnail to see an enlargement of the image.
