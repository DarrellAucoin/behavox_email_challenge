Karen and I will handle stuff for pizza friday night, and most of dinner
Saturday (thinking scallops and ???).  Will scallops work, Prentice?  If
not, have a suggested alternate or something to add that you'd like?

Jeff can you bring breakfast stuff for both mornings and salad stuff for
friday and saturday eve.

We figure we can pick up saturday lunch items on saturday....

Cool????
