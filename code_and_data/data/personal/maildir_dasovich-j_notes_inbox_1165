Ha!  I knew I was right!  Shelley said she was pretty sure you would NOT be 
there.
TW Commercial is dressed casual and feeling the effects of too much tequila, 
but we'll be lunching nonetheless...
play your cards right and you might get to ride in the Excursion.

P.s.  to get the right Susan Scott, just type "susan.scott@enron.com".  the 
Other Susan has to use her middle initial, cuz I was here first.

Are you free for drinks and/or dinner in SF on Monday?

Little bird tells me that I may be lunching with you two at the 4 seasons 
today.  Is that right?
