PG&E is trying to rewrite history.  As I mentioned, the following Advice 
Letter requests that the CPUC value hydro at $2.8 billion versus $1 billion 
effective June 28, 2000.  We are concerned that the purpose of this maneuver 
is so that PG&E can claim the rate freeze had ended at the end of June and 
that they can pass on the high cost of energy beginning July to retail 
customers versus incurring the shareholder risks. I'm almost surprised PG&E 
didn't claim the value effective June 12 -- the day before the high prices 
began.  This is disgusting.  PG&E has absolutely no shame!  We'll be making 
an all-out effort to keep this from happening.  Hope we can work together.
