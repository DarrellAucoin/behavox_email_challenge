Subject: Picks of the Week--Final Results & PLAYOFF POOL
X-FileName: jdasovic.nsf

Congratulations, Brady, for a great finish. He edged out Cameron by just
thirteen points. The Commish kept his third-place position with a nine point
margin over JAM and Narvco who tied for fourth. Only three points back were
Cindy and Helmet.
The week was won by Growney, followed by JAM, Cindy, Helmet and Prentice
(tied for 4th place).
I attempted to send out the results when we were in San Diego for the
Christmas holiday, but even if you received them, I made the mistake of
stating that the points used in the Playoff Pool ranked from 15 to 5. I
should have said 11 down to 1. If you will acknowledge this via e-mail, I
would appreciate it so I won't have to call a lot of people to make sure
there's no misunderstanding. Here are the rules again:
PLAYOFF POOL
The rules will be similar to the Weekly Pool, but the whole playoff series
will be treated as one week. You will decide how many points to give each
potential game winner, and since there are eleven games you have from 1-11
points available for each game, but you cannot use the same number more than
once. Each week you turn in your picks for the teams playing that particular
week. That means you have only one number left for the Super Bowl. Please
note in the schedule of Payouts below that there is a payout of $50.00 for
last place. This could make it interesting for someone who hasn't done too
well toward the end of the playoffs.

The payout for the Playoff Pool is:
1st $130.00; 2nd $90.00; 3rd $70.00; Last $50.00
