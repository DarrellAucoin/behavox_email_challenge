Subject: Halloween Party
X-FileName: jdasovic.nsf

Our friends....

Nothing to do on the Saturday before Halloween?  Bored of the same ol'
costumes and Bridge 'n Tunnel crowd down in the Castro?  Want to strangle
the next guy you see dressed up as the Golden Gate Bridge?  Well then, have
we got a bash for you!   It's Rob and Madeleine's last minute Halloween
fiasco.  Sure to be a hit for all ages and attitudes.  Think about
it.....when you combine Madeleine's penchant for over-supplying good food
and drink, insistence on bringing in outside help and making sure everyone's
happy....with Rob's delight for doing the strange and unexpected (especially
with pumpkins!) on his favorite holiday....then this is sure to be a hit.

....and if it's not, we'll at least I've had practice with good creative
copywriting.

Here are the details.

When:  Saturday October 28.  6:30 - ? (We're starting early so those who
want to see the gawkers with cameras in the Castro can get there by mid
evening).

Where:  1228 Grove #1 (and maybe #'s 2-6 if my friendly neighbors open their
doors to make this a big building party).  We're located at the edge of
Alamo Square Park near the corner of Scott and Grove.

Why:  Because I love Halloween and Madeleine loves bobbing for apples.
And...because you're never to old to have Halloween fun.

What Happens:   Basically anything you want to.  But we'll be encouraging...

Creative pumpkin carving in our special carving room (bring your own pumpkin
and carving utensils, and we'll supply the newspaper and votive candles to
light up your scary creation....Generous, aren't we.)

Marshmallow roasting on our neighbor's home-made grill pit in the back yard
(a Weber stacked with wood)

Wine tasting and beer quaffing (free entry to the one who finds a good
pumpkin wine).
All night food snacking (not a formal dinner, but should be enough goodies
to compliment a few glasses of your favorite venom)

Informal costume judging (costumes not required, but c'mon, it's
Halloween....relax, have fun, live a little, dress up!)  No parading around
for this one, simply tap the ghoul on the shoulder you think has an
outrageous get-up and give 'em some credit for putting it on.

Devilish music (we're thinking a deluge of Wagnerian movements (Faust
anybody?)...but bring some of your own to share as well)


What to bring:  Yourself, hopefully a costume (no, you're not required), a
pumpkin if you wish and one small thing to share with a few others to imbibe
or devour (we'll supply the lion's share).  Be creative!

RSVP?  Absolutely...we need to now if we should notify the police of the
impending ruckus!   Use this e-mail (roblevy@earthlink.net or
madeleinet@earthlink.net).  Do so by the 23rd if you can.

Cheers!

Rob and Madeleine (Levy and Todd)
