Hi Frank,

Thanks for your note.  The no comment policy is probably the best idea, but your comment actually turned out to work very well in the story.  I'd rather be lucky than good any time.

Mark

Last night I was interviewed by Shern-Min Chow, I was quoted as saying "I don't know if he's gonna take the money.  He might turn it down, there are rumors to that effect."  I apologize for making that statement.  In the future, I will not give quotes other than "no comment."
