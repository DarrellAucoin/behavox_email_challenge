Kevin has agreed to drive over to my house at 7am and pick us all up in the
Winnebago.  Guz - you can sleep in the back on the way down and a while
after we get there if you want.  This may prevent you from falling asleep at
the Peacock later in the day.  Chris can attest that sleeping in bars is not
wise.

Guz, I will leave a key under the front door mat.  Rueben and Sepp know that
you are coming over early.  I'll leave some blankets on a couch for you.

Almost everyone could sleep in the winny.

Gas will be between $5 and $8 each.

We will come home Sunday morning.
