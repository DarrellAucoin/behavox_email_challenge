Hi Mark,

I think I'm finally convinced that it's probably best to have an alcoholic as 
President following Clinton's sexual escapades!!? This way in four years we 
can try to find a recovering drug addict to keep the faith.? Then, we can 
just turn the White House into a whore house because a Mexican Pimp could 
then be our next choice? -? what do ya think?!?

Don't forget to vote for Gore to offset my Bush vote!!

Love ya - mean it!!!?? UNCLE BOB
