many thanks to those that responded to my plea for money.  if those checks 
are really in the mail then we should be registered this week.  i am thinking 
of going to the batting cages on Thursday, so if anyone else is interested 
let me know.  if you havent sent in a check yet, then meet me there if you 
can.  the batting cages that i go to are near the malibu grand prix on hwy 
217 and scholls ferry (across from your friends in the diamond business), and 
i think 8pm is a good time.  keep the money coming and see ya later.
chris
