Subject: Letter Offer for Sale of Land in North Harris County
X-FileName: dhyvl.nsf

I have drafted and attached a basic offer to an adjacent land owner for a
property sale.  He and I have negotiated this for some time and this is
basically my final offer.

Please critique this letter and advise me at your earliest convenience of
the changes you would require before this is sent out.
