Dear  All, 
 
It  looks like we will have to change this meeting date and time because of  conflicts.  I will try to come up w/another date and time w/your  help.  What does Thursday, Dec. 20, around 5:00 p.m. look  like on your calendars?  If that does not work please give me some other  option.  Thanks,  Mom/Linda
