For all those who do not already know the doorman at
the Huntindon, Reuben passed away un expectantly.
Apparently, he contracted Pneumonia which lead to his
lungs failing.  He had just celebrated his 60th
birthday that weekend.
There is collection being taken up by the staff at the
huntingdon to assist with funeral expenses and
returning the body to Mexico.  I any of you wish to
make a donation you can give it to me and I will see
that it gets to the family.

Barb
