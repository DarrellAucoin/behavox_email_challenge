Hi - I'll be honest - I thought you were cute.  Hopefully you are as interesting as you are attractive :)

The following is my profile text:

I never thought I'd be using a "dating service". But I'm open to trying new things - so let's give it a try. I'm an outgoing, positive, fun person. I LOVE to travela nd experince new places and cultures. I'm always learning something new - right now it's the guitar. I'm also really happy being alone with myself to read, write, or just putz around. I love kids, and they love me - probably because I'm pretty much a kid at heart still. I'm very close to my family and have probably too many good friends - I spend a lot of time keeping up with them all.

ADDITIONAL TIPS from Match.com:

Our anonymous re-mailer will strip away your real email address, so 
that it will NOT appear in the 'From:' line.

You may also contact this person from their Match.com profile by 
clicking 'Contact this person' and composing your message directly from the 
site.

However:

* Check to ensure that your email address is not in the BODY of your 
message as we are unable to remove these.

* Check to ensure that you REMOVE ANY AUTOMATIC SIGNATURE at the end of 

your email. And note that you cannot use 'Cc:' or 'Bcc:' if you want 
your email to remain anonymous.
