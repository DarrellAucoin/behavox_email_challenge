I think most of you know that we gave Jeff a gift certificate for Forno's,
which came with a free night of babysitting, by me.  We also gave trophies
to the assistant coaches.  I know some of you have reimbursed me.  If you
have not and would like to do so, (naturally, it is purely voluntary),
please send $10 to:

Beth Hurst
502 Regentview Dr.
Houston, TX   77079-6909

Thanks, Beth
