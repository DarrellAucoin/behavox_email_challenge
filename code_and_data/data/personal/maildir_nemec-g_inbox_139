Hey there!

Saw your brother again last night.  Where were you?  I think I have given up
on Taco Milagro.  Very nasty crowd that hangs out there now.  I say that
every week..but it's just so close to my place that it makes it easy to hang
out there and then not have far to drive home!

Anyway, sometimes your brother acknowledges me and sometimes he doesn't.
Maybe he didn't see me.

What are you up to this weekend?
