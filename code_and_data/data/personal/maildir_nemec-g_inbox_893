G,

I'm sure you guys rocked--so hard--on Saturday.  If I hadn't been on my
deathbed I would have toughed it out.  I listened to you guys message as it
came in, I know it you be you guys harassing me.  Laura heard it the next
day and asked "you don't think JT was really over there......do you?"

Anyway, I guess I owe somebody 16 bucks.   I also need to get your house
key back to you.  Has any mail or magazines of mine randomly shown up at
your place, lately?

OUT!
