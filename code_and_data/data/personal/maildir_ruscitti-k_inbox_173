Ed, 

Sorry, but I must concur with Mr.Claffey. 

I do believe the question posed asked to list specific outfield postions (ie: Leftfield, Centefield and Rightfield) which your suprisingly quick response failed to address.  Most of the great ballplayers played certain "outfield" positions based on their fielding abilities or lack thereof to play the other outfield positions. 

I'll let you slide (barely) on your broad references to "outfield" on Roger Maris and Dale Murphy and Barry Bonds, however, 

No true baseball expert would ever be so casual as to list Mickey Mantle's position as simply "Outfield" 

I believe you owe baseball fans, especially the Yankee snobs (I was always a Mets fan) an apology for so boldly disrespecting the position of Centerfield.
