If anyone is interested in playing mixed doubles this Sunday from 9-11 please let me know. I need one person to fill in.  It is a fun group of men, older, but good tennis players.  We meet at 9 at the City Club near Compaq center and usually play three sets.

Please let me know if you are interested.

Thanks,

Amy
