Hello everyone!  I hope all of you are doing well!  I am getting so excited
about this weekend and the Christmas shower!  Don't forget to RSVP - it is my
cousin, Josie Flesher's number (713-626-9466) and she is not there during the
day, so you can just leave a message.

Hope to see you guys this weekend!

Love, Lisa
