Jeff,

Al and I would like to thank you for your kind endorsement of Expectations
Investing. We look forward to sending you a final copy when it is published
in early September.

I would love to catch up with you. Please let me know if you're in NY with a
few extra moments-alternatively, I'd be pleased to come to Houston.

Best regards,

Michael
