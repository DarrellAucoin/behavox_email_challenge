  Good afternoon!  I accessed your name on the 1400smith.com list. We are an executive  search firm specializing in placements within the power and energy  industry nationwide, and your title comes up as a good fit for several of  our current searches.  Would you be so kind as to send a Word copy of your resume along with  your contact information so that one of our search consultants can speak  to you about a career opportunity?   Looking forward to hearing from you, and have a great  day!  Sincerely,   Suzanne Tonini Internet Research Pangaea Technology Resources 563 SW 13th St #100 Bend, OR. 97701 (541) 382-9779 stonini@pangaeatek.com
