Hey,
The weather here is awesome...cloudy and low 90's.
My family is coming down this weekend for the Oregon /UA game....you must be
the biggest Duck fan in Texas.

Sorry to hear about your Aruba trip. 14-16 October sounds good. I don't have
a calendar in front of me. Let's talk in the next week. I'll call you at work.
