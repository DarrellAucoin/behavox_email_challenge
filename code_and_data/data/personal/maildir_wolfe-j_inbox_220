I don't mean to intrude, but I saw where you placed an ebay bid for 1981 Fleer.  I wish you the best of luck on the auction, but if you get outbid or want additional copies, www.baseball.dtshops.com has 1981 Fleer for sale at a cost $1.00.

The website has inventories, s/h info, and ordering details.  You can find it at:

www.baseball.dtshops.com

As I said, I don't mean to intrude.  So if you find this info annoying you can make sure you don't receive any by Clicking this link: http://www.dtutils.net/cgi-bin/EM/Unsubscribe.pl?User=jason.wolfe@enron.com.
