Dearest Trav, 
Saturday night was really special.  I've never had a five-way before, and it was surprisingly comfortable.  Thanks for setting up that TV for me to watch next to where the real action was going on.  Most guys wouldn't have done that for me.  You're a wonderful guy, and I'll be sure to invite you to all my upcoming multipartner fests.
Still sore, 
Matt 
PS. Please pass on my thanks and accolades to you're gorgeous bikini-clad girlie and that hot dog.
