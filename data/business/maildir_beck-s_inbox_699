Hi Sally,
 
Do you know where we stand with the Enron America's changes? I presume the Operations people are working with the business people and will then get with the IT people once decision have been made ?
 
Are we done with EES, I heard that Fallon is going to speak to Whalley about their position (i.e. no changes).
 
Are there more questions to ask the EGM/EIM busineses, are these being asked ?
 
Can you send me the spreadsheet we put together.
 
Thanks

Mark Pickering 
Chief Technology Officer
