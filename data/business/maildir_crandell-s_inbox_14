Subject: RTOs and Emerging Pool Markets--North American Overview
X-FileName: 

At Jim Steffes request, I have assembled a matrix of the status of current emerging RTOs/standard markets in North America.

Sarah, could you look at the "next steps" and let me know if I missed anything major?

Also, does any body know if EPSA or some other organization is maintaining a similar overview database.  (FERC's site is out of date).

I will keep the latest version of this on the 0:\public affairs\RTO information database directory.  

Alan
