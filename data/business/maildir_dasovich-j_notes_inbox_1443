Jeff, I read in Gas Daily that the Cal PUC has issued an OII on the adequacy 
of supply and pipeline infrastructure in southern California.  Could you have 
someone send me a copy of the order whenever it is issued?  Steve thinks it's 
something we might want to get involved in, but I need to know more.  

Great to see you last week.

Ciao,
Susan
