11/21. The Los Angeles  City Council adopted a resolution pertaining to 
access to  broadband cable Internet access facilities. The resolution was  
sponsored by Alex  Padilla, and adopted unanimously. It does not mandate 
open  access; rather, it is a collection of policy positions regarding  open 
access, and an instruction to the City Attorney to promote them  in 
proceedings before the FCC, FTC and CPUC. A draft copy of the  resolution 
reads, in part: "RESOLVE that the City Attorney is hereby  instructed and 
authorized to represent the City in any rulemaking or  other proceedings 
before the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, the  California Public Utility 
Commission, or any other proceedings that  relate to Internet transmission 
over cable facilities in a manner  that encourages results consistent with 
this Resolution." See, Los  Angeles City Council Agenda for Nov. 21, at Item 
No 9.
