Mona,

Following up on our earlier conversation, I believe you had someone call
Jot Condie with the California Restaurant Association regarding his San
Diego members.  Unfortunately, with all of the mayhem surrounding the
final weeks of session, Jot misplaced that person's name and number.

Jot called me again today to apologize for losing the information and to
say that his members are still concerned about the energy situation in
San Diego.  Some are so upset with SDG&E that they would like to switch
to a new ESP now.  Jot would like to arrange a meeting with an Enron
representative and some of his San Diego members to discuss options,
including but not limited to, aggregation.  He can be reached at (916)
431-2724.

Thank you again for your help with this.

Scott
