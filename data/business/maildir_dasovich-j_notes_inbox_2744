I spoke to Jason.  Told him we had been advocating a core/non-core solution 
similar to natural gas market.  He said he had it from other sources that we 
sent a four page recommendation to the "speaker."  I told him I didn't know 
how many pages or to whom, but that we had submitted some ideas.  His 
questions were in response to calls after stories appeared yesterday.

Did I kill our chances?
