Subject: PX credits & Schedule F in the PG&E bankruptcy
X-FileName: jdasovic.nsf

PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
Schedule F:

Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61

Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
described as PX Credit in nature. 

Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.

Regards,


Michael
