If Southern California Edison is the same company as Edison Mission, you will 
presumably be pointing out to your American colleagues that while Edison are 
complaining about generators taking advantage of the California situation to 
the detriment of customers, Edison are doing exactly the same here by selling 
power into the balancing market at o5000 / MWh!
