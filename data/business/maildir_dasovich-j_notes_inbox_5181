Here is the draft letter for the direct access coalition to send to Bilas on
Friday.  It must be made into a formal letter with a service certificate.
So... Scott can you distribute it to the full direct access coalition and
ask them to directly reply to me if they want to be added to the letter we
send or do they want to send their own comments?  We would like a response
by Thursday noon.

Comments by Enron personnel can be sent to me directly as well.

Thanks, Mike Day
