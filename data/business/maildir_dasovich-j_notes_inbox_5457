Subject: Home Depot Spreadsheet (revised)
X-FileName: jdasovic.nsf

Jeff was kind enough to show me where to get the additional balance sheet 
items
I needed to finish the financial ratio time sheet analysis (I missed the
selected financial statement table).  Please see the revised spreadsheet that
has both the financial ratios and the pro forma cash flow statement for the 
next
fiscal year.
