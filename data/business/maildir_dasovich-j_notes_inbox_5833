I was approached by an attorney (in Texas) whose firm represents the CA 
Legislature in  studying energy-related issues and was asked why Enron (or 
any other retail marketer) is not advocating benefits of dereg on behalf of 
the end-user.  I assume that means certain discussions (which, I don't know) 
that thier attorneys are present have only included a  view of dereg. from 
the government, utility and power marketers.  I may be able to get more 
detail if you are interested.
