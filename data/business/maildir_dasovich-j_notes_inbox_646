Hi Jeff,  Great  organization  and  great  stuff here... Three  comments  on  
the   message  you  have  prepared. 

 All  US   Hi  tech is   8 percent of  the US   GNP-- not just   
California's  hi  tech  share... ( which  I think  is how  it  now  
reads.....)

I would  add under " Last Century Infrastructure "    that  Calif. only  
added    670 MW  in the past  5 years  when it  needed
5500 MW--  it  needed   8   times  more  than  was  actually  built  but 
could not  get  built  due to   siting   restrictions...

On last  Slide   last  line  Small  typo     reads "  a....a...." 

Great job..   Margaret..
