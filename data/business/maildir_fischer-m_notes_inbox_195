Ilan,

1.  We have not received the European data yet.

2.  The data does include the first 90 days in both the EA and the VA.  We 
can exclude the first 90 days if that is desirable.

Regards,
Hollis

Hollis - 

Looks good.  Now lets see if we get some comments from some other people.  A 
couple of questions:

1) Does this mean you have the April data for Europe as well, if so please 
send them?

2) According to our calculation of EA, the first 90 days should not be 
included.  Is that how the document was calculated?

Thanks,
Ilan
