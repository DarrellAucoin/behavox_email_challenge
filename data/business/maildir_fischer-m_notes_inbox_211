Subject: Lessons Learned Matrix for 2001 Projects
X-FileName: mark fischer 7-12-02 LNotes.nsf

All,

Attached is the Lessons Learned matrix developed from our meeting last week.  
I want to thank everyone who participated.  There were some who wanted to 
attend but could not because of the GE Integration efforts.  We missed you, 
but your interests were represented by people from your teams.  

Originally, the Top 15 issues were identified and voted on by all functional 
teams.  During our session last week, three of these issues were combined, 
making the final list 12 issues.  The sub-issues, within each major issue, is 
labeled, for example, 1.1, with the root causes labelled 1.1.1.  Dan 
Lindquist did an outstanding job of facilitating our lessons learned 
process.  Normally, we would have hired a third party facilitator, but due to 
cost constraints this was not possible; therefore, we utilized Dan.  
Collectively Dan and I developed this matrix.   As you will note, there are 
numerous global issues.  The plan is to coordinate a meeting with Germany to 
discuss face to face all of our collective issues, so that improvements can 
be made for our mutual benefit. 

The plan is to develop a series of Six Sigma Green Belt projects from these 
issues, as a part of our Six Sigma training, which will come in the next week 
or so.  Dan is already coordinating this with a GEPS Six Sigma Black Belt 
person from Atlanta.  The plan is to assign two people to each "Green Belt 
Project"; therefore, start thinking about which project you may want to be on.

If I have missed anyone within your team, please forward on to them.  Thanks

Best regards,

Jeff
