We are meeting with the German and Spanish representatives at the end of 
March to discuss short term and long term SCADA objectives.

1)
Please provide me with known issues we need to improve the current VisuPro

2)
Provide me with longer term (next 3 - 5 years) requirements/wish list to 
include in a completely optimized SCADA system.

I'd like input by March 18.
Contact me if additional information or explanation required.

Thank you

Ron
