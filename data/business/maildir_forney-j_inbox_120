here is a product we are beginning to pitch in ERCOT.  Just thought you might be interested in using this as a template for your own product.  I also would appreciate your feedback on the structure.  If you have any ideas how to make it better or see problems with it, please let me know.  THanks.

Joe,

Please take a look at this template.  I need you to look closely at the Index Price section & the fixed retail adders.  Are you taking the consumption risk on the retail adders?

I need this tomorrow morning.

  
\Thanks!

Trish
