JMF,

I have a discrepancy with LCRA on 10/22/01.  The following notes are in the P&L...

"830711,830709 .  The original deal was a buy from LCRA and a sale to RESI but LCRA did not enter into Portal in time.  Therefore the purchase was made from the ERCOT Imbal. market where it was purchased for $11.55."

The initials in the P&L are 'GTP'

We show this in the system as an ERCOT-Imbalance purchase and a sale to Reliant however LCRA claims that we should show this purchase from them.

Please pass this along to the appropriate trader to clear up the discrepancy.

Thanks,
MJ
