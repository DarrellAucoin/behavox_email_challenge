John,

Per our conversation yesterday this is an email to clarify the ERCOT counterparty names that are in EnPower...

ERCOT Imbalance - ERCOT-IMBA - this counterparty is for commodities (must select a delivery point and have a zero price)
EPMI-ERCOT-POOL - EPMI-ERCOT - this counterparty is for transmission only (zero price)


Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. - ERCOT - this counterparty is for interdesk annuities

Thanks,
Michael
