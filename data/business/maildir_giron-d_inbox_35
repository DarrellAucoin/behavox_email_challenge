HI:

Thank you for a productive meeting this morning! Per our discussion, we will need Risk and Credit Aggregation to pull the same Post IDs in order to have counterparties $ exposure to reconcile. In addition, corporations and its divisions should be matched to arrive to the similar counterparty list, as well as the decision should be made on whether to include ENA Affiliates for this particular exercise. 

Below is the contact information:
