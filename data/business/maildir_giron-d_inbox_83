I just got back from UBS orientation and will start work on it now.  Will let you know when I'm done.  I should be able to finish before 3:30p.m. (if there are not too many deals)

Please move the following six counterparties from NG-Price to Bankruptcy.  Please move only financial deals.  Please let me know when this is complete.  We need to have it done by the time we calc our books today - no exceptions.  Thanks for your help.
