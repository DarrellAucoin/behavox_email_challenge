We sold Aquila our transmission rights from NOB/Big Eddy 10 mw llh for 11/28

The path is:

Burbank@Toluka>Burbank(T)Toluca/Sylmar/NOB-Burbank-APC-EPMI-BPA(T)NOB/BE 
O#311916-APC-FRPUD(T)BPA(T)BE/EWEB SYS O#10043-APC-EWEB

Aquila tagged this, it is their number 138478.  The Enpower Deal numbers for 
Aquila are 467002 and 467003

I called BPA to arrange for the transmission, if there are any questions the 
RODS account is 660292

You should not have to do anything to this, if the transmission is cut, it is 
not to be resupplied.  Aquila bought this as take or pay transmission.

Thanks,

Cara
