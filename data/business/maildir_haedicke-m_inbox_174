Subject: DRAFT PRESS RELEASE: Coburg Power
X-FileName: MHAEDIC (Non-Privileged).pst

Attached is a draft press for Coburg Power regarding our decision not to renew our exclusivity agreement.  Any thoughts?

They do not have a planned release date yet, but we expect it to be sometime this week or next once they have received approval from us.

Eric
