Further to our conversation Friday night...??was that Friday?   anyway we
have the following needs.

An L/C to Henry petroleum for $1.4  mil.  This app is at Enron and was
originally sent  to Chase for issuance..now Chase says no.  ( this one is
getting touchy)

New apps being forwarded this morning that need issuing.

Ultramar Diamond Shamrock $15.0 mil
Astra Energy Canada $3.3 mil
Koch Canada  $800,000

Pending:

Choctaw II Oil and Gas :   $1,0 mill.....we are waiting for the verdict on
this one..but don't hold much hope for getting out of it.   Should know
this morning.


ALSO;;;;;;;NEED TO HAVE COST NUMBERS ON THESE L/C'S   SOME OF THE CUSTOMERS
ARE OFFERRING TO PAY FOR THEM BUT WANT A NUMBER
