Subject: Merger Between Norske Skog Canada Limited and Pacifica Papers Inc.
X-FileName: MHEARD (Non-Privileged).pst

It is my understanding that the companies mentioned above have been amalgamated, with Norske Skog Canada Limited retaining the name.  Are you aware that this occurred?  Norske Skog is wanting me to bill Pacifica Paper's swaps under Norske Skog's name going forward.

Please let me know!

Thanks,
Gordon
