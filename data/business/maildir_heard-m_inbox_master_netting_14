Marie,

You may already have this in your list, but just in case, Crown Central is another counterparty that submitted their form of netting agreement for execution.  Nidia Mendoza has already provided Jay Williams with copy of it.  Please add to the list of negotiations and assign it to John Viverito as well.

Thanks.
Nony

Nony-

Please also double check with Marie regarding Crown Central, which has also requested a netting agreement, but has not yet made the list.  

The coordinator from credit who needs to be notified regarding all netting agreements is Jason (Jay) Williams.  I believe that Nidia Mendoza is already in contact with him, but we should follow up.

Thanks,

John

Please make sure Marie Heard adds this to the list of netting agreement negotiations, and assigns to John.
Thanks.

Jay,

We received a fax copy of a Net Settlement Agreement for crude products (ERAC) from Valero.  We're delivering a copy to you this afternoon for further handling.  Please let us know if we can help in any way.

Regards,

Nony Flores
