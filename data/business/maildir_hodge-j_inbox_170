Hi, am going to copy you on the penalty language and sample confirm with penalty language I sent to Matt Fleming today.  I will follow up and forward to you, a sample of a normal fully-managed confirmation.  I think the "normal" confirm could easily be duplicated.  I will also send a more complex version that I think will have to be done by Legal.

See below for penalty language info.
Thanks, Christy

Here is a sample confirmation showing what we would do with Tier 4 penalty language on a term deal.  On a spot deal, the GTC's would just be attached.  Also attached is a sample of Tier Language for your use.
