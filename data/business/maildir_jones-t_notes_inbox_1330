Subject: Kimberly Clark Draft Confirm Annex B
X-FileName: tjones.nsf

Attached are the credit provisions for the Annexes B, B-1 that we would 
include in a deemed ISDA deal with Kimberly Clark de Mexico.  The c/p wants 
to see what the confirm will look like.  Agustin will call Souad to draft the 
confirm.  I presume that Souad will contact you for the Credit addenda.
