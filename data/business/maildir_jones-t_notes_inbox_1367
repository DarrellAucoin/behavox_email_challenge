Tom, Tana, and Karen--

Attached are profiles for the Clickpaper counterparties we have all processed 
to date.  Tomorrow (Tuesday)
we will have the ability to designate whether a CP has Financial or Physical 
access, whether an ISDA or  MPA is in place and if not,
what type of GTC to post on-line.

Our target time for the upload is 3:00 pm (after market close).  It would be 
great if you could review this new detail for the 
system change.  For each company, I have noted the response from you, ISDA 
and MPA information, and whether a GTC with collateral
is required.  I hope it is summarized so that it goes quickly.

If you have any questions, please call me at 3-6150 or page me at 
1-800-913-7857. 

Thanks very much,
Camille
