In the previous credit worksheet for the Master Agreement I incorrectly 
identified the entity we would like to contract with.  In this new worksheet, 
I have provided the correct entity we would like to enter into this contract 
with.  Please disregard the previous entity and instead refer to this credit 
worksheet.

thanks
brant
