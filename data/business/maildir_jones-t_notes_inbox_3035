Subject: Coastal Merger into El Paso Merchant
X-FileName: tjones.nsf

There was a copy of a Certificate of Merger, State Certification and a letter 
announcing Coastal Merchant Energy LP merging with and into El Paso Merchant 
Energy, LP.  These documents were sitting on my desk this morning.  I don't 
know where they came from or who put it on my desk but is anyone in legal 
working on this merger?  I have not seen any e-mails on it yet.  

Thanks, Georgi
