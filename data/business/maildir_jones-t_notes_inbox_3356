I agree.  This is another instance of a case where products seem to have been 
opened/not correctly updated/changed.  I think it's safe to assume that they 
shouldn't be trading Dutch power...

Also, they appear to be open for a slew of other European products for which 
they shouldn't be open.  Thanks for the catch.

Is there any reason why this counterparty has transact on NL power?  I cannot 
believe they have a power marketing license there?
