Taffy/Tana, Thanks for sending us the requested doc.s

Paul, I have started to prepare the mirror English Law doc.s.  Just a few 
questions:

Schedule:

1. Elligible Currency - I presume that in addition to USD we will have 
sterling?  And Euros?

2. Is an Enron Corp. guaranty to be provided?

CSA:

3. Notification time/Resolution time in the US doc.s are 10 am and 1 pm New 
York time respectively.  I suggest that mid afternoon London time should be 
adopted for the convenience of both parties.

Many thanks
Michael
