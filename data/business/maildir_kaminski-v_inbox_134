Hello,
 
My name is Pamela Yoo with the California Energy Commission,  here in Sacramento, California.  I sent out invitations about a week ago  for the upcoming North American Regional Gas Model User Meeting that will be  held in our area on January 17-18, 2002.

I have attached the original invitation letter to this email,  for your convenience.  You may send in your information  via fax (the fax number is written on the form of the following attachment) or  email (pyoo@energy.state.ca.us
