Dear Vince,

I will be in Houston from the 1 July to (at least) the 7th July. 

I will call you tomorrow morning (Houston time) to discuss the current issues and how we can move forward in a way that is beneficial 
for Enron North America (the research group, the gas desk and the power desk). I would like to use tomorrow's call to highlight my 
point of view and where we are heading. Basically, I would like to discuss a plan of action. 
Thanks.

Regards,
Christian
