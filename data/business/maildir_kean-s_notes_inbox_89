15 USC 3361 allows the President to declare a natural gas supply emergency if 
there is a severe shortage or one is imminent in the US or any region 
thereof.  I have not examined this section in detail, and I think it may 
address allocation more than anything, but it may be something we want to 
look at.  I don't think it was repealed in 89 ir 92.
