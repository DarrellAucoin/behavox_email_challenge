Subject: FW: UBS Warburg Energy - First Priority Trading Agreements
X-FileName: louise kitchen 2-7-02.pst


The first group of trading contracts will go out to 77 companies for a total of 168 counterparties (most companies have multiple entities).  This group obviously does not include everyone, but we have most of our major relationships (and it is the official list that has been submitted to UBS for credit approval.)  

The general marketing plan is as follows:
- Contact all customers this week to tell them about UBS Warburg Energy
- Get contract/PA packages in front of First Priority counterparties this week
- Arrange meetings or follow-up calls as appropriate
- Dave Forster and the ubswenergy.com team will be sending out online PA packages to all parties later this week (so it is important to have contacted all customers)
- Once the initial wave of contracts is out and review/negotiations are uderway, we will submit a Second Priority list for credit approval

The attached file has all of the First Priority counterparties, along with names for gas, power, online, credit and legal.   Apologies for the imperfect information - it came from several different sources.  In addition, we have columns for describing the type of agreement and its status (not pursuing, incomplete, done).  Please complete and/or edit the attached and forward to either Debra Bailey or Lloyd Will.  If you think you should take the lead on a particular counterparty, call up the other person and work it out!  Progress on this effort will be reviewed during our twice-weekly calls.
