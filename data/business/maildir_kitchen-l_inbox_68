Subject: Credit Risk Control Presentation to Traders-Feb 7
X-FileName: louise kitchen 2-7-02.pst

     I've attached the draft of the CRC presentation to traders slotted for
     this Thursday afternoon.  The Bill's will be presenting but we intend
     to have all of UBSWE Credit attend.  The New Business Group also asked
     to tag onto the end of this.
