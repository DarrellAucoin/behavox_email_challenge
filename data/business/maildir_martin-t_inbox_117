Hey Gang,

Could you guys review the attached list of products as I attempted to match EOL product to Risk Book and Trader... The sheet 'current' is a list of all products, the sheet 'Texas' is my attempt to carve out Texas related products only... Risk Books will be as follows:

Tom	FB-Texas1
Jim	FB-Texas2
Eric	FB-Texas3
Charlie	FB-Texas4
Dave	FB-Texas6
