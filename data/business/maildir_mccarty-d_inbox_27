Subject:  PG&E 2001 Capacity Release Transactions on Transwestern Pipeline
X-FileName: DMCCARTY (Non-Privileged).pst


FYI

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million
