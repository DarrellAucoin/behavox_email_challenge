Paul:

Here are the particulars again:

Term:          1/1/04 - 12/31/08
Volume:   50 - 100 MW
Heat Rate:     7.4 MMBtu /Mwh
Index:         SoCal + $.05
Delivery: Mead / LD / Physical


This would be on a 7x24 basis, though we would consider a structure which
would allow you the optionality to exercise peak on and off peak
as seperate options.  Let me know what you think.
