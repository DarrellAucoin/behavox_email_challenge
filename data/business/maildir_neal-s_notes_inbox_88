Effective 5/1/01 through 10/31/01 we have a 10,000 MMBtu/d index put at 
Dominion South Point to PSEG.  We can do as much as we want in any month, 
within the 0-10,000 MMBtu/d parameters, but we can do no more than 920,000 
MMBtu for the whole term.  We need to keep a running tally of how much we 
use.  Starting on Monday, can we keep this tally on the morning sheet and 
update it daily?
