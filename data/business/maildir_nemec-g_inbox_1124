Mary, the last (and only) time I saw these was in a joint meeting with AnnElizabeth and Robert Rose.  Robert actually had these documents, executed and available.  However, the point was raised that one set of the documents was never filed with the courthouse.  If you can get a copy from Robert Rose, you should.  Also, if anyone in legal knows how to check whether they were filed, we should do that as well.
Cheers,
Pat

Dear Patrick:  We are trying to obtain copies of the document whereby Enron Storage Company conveyed the Napoleonville land assets to LRCI, Inc.  They were probably part of the Bridgeline closing documents.  Do you have any documents that support this conveyance?

Please advise.

Thanks, 
Mary
