Gerald:

Attached is another draft of the Purchase and Sale Agreement with
several revisions.  I revised the property description because the
description I used before was supplied by the appraiser and was not
definite enough.  I inserted the Tax ID numbers and correct addresses
and deleted the L.P. as an intervenor.  I also set up the Cash Sale so
that it could be executed in counterparts rather than at a single closing.

The survey plat supplied with the Appraisal report appears to for the
5.081 acre tract of land previously sold.  Do you have a survey of the
Subject Property?

I will send this revised draft to the Police Jury on Monday.
