Andy,
	Here's a revised draft.  Several comments.
	1.  I'm putting together a list of potential arbitrators.  Let's
compare notes next week.
	2.  Subject to getting a better feel for what the damages are, we
would take this case on a contingent fee, blended, or other creative basis
where the fee is tied to the result obtained.  Let us know if that's
something Enron would be interested in discussing.
	3.  If you wish, we can certainly put Tom on the pleadings. Also,
what's your preference re to being named as as counsel on your cases.  (On
cases with Lohse, we usually put both our names on the pleadings.)  Let me
know your preference.
