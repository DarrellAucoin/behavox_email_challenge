Carol,

Attached is the collateral Agreement that Duke Energy Trading & Marketing would like to have executed to cover the physical gas positions.  Please review the agreement and give any one of us a call here in credit if you have any questions.  

The attorney that will be working on the agreement at Duke is Joe Forbes and you can reach him at 713-627-6124.

Thanks,

Veronica
