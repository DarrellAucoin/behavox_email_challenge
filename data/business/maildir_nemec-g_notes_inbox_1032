Good Morning-

Just wanted to let everyone know that I got a phone call from Kent Harris 
with Kinder Morgan this morning telling me that the Tom Brown acquistion of 
the Wildhorse assets was completed on Friday, November 17th.  He wants to set 
up a Data Room for us to get our initial data from them during the week of 
November 27th.  I will have more specifics by later today or Monday, November 
27th.

Audrey
