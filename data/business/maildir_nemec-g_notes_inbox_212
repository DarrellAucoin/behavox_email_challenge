I asked Fannette to deliver a PA from WBI that needs to be executed and 
returned by July 14.  Can you please review and add the standard "management 
out" on our side.  I briefly reviewed and noticed that WBI has a couple of 
unilateral "outs", but nothing for us.

Please advise.

Thanks

Stephanie
