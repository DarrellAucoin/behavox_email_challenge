Eric - Gerald is forwarding the Calpine contract to you so that you can  get 
Rob's signature. Kevin is helping me with language for the amendment to 
ensure that the transaction correctly represents the "renewal" volume (NOVA) 
and thermal quantities (ANG)  accurately. 

Please advise if you have any questions. I plan to post this transaction on 
PGT's bulletin board today.

Regards,

Stephanie
