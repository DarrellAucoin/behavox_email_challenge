Carol:

We met with James Centilli and went over the calculations.  We included an 
energy charge credit to rate 19's calculation.  I am forwarding the new 
spreadsheet to you.  

There were also some issues under rate 21, regarding the avoidance of on peak 
demand charge.  Knippa is revising it with Gerald Nemec, and I would let you 
know whenever we get feedback from him.  


Please call me if you want me to explain to you the calculations.

Maria Tefel
