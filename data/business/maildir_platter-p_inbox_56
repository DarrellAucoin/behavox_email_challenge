Due to the tentative completion date of the UBS deal, I think it would be wise for me to resume the duties of scheduling the California book as of Monday February 4, 2002. After meeting with Murray, I am under the impression that as of Wednesday you will be on UBS time and will not be doing the scheduling for the estate.  Let me know if you see a flaw in this plan, thanks, Serena Bishop
