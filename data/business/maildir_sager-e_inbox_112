Attached is a slightly revised version of the Second Amendment.  The word
party in the second sentence of paragraph 11 has been capitalized and the
line in Exhibit B regarding replacement collateral has been deleted.  These
changes were part of Elizabeth Sager's comments earlier.  If you have any
questions, please call.
