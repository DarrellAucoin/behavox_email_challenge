A search of those states currently accessible online shows the filing by
Columbia Southern on April 1, 2001, in Ohio, number AP32886.  Indiana,
Maryland, and Pennsylvania gave results online but showed no filing.  We
could not access online Virgina, Michigan, Georgia, New Jersey or California
at this time.  We will follow up with a onsite search if you want it.

   Attached is the first UCC search we could retrieve. A more recent and
   definitive search is on order.  Note that Columbus Southern Power
   already
   claims a security interest on all of NPW's accounts receivable.  We need
   to
   inquire of NPW about this report.
