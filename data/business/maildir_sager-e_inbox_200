We received the last batch of fully executed Financial confirms from New Power today. As well, all of the Sept.01 forward Physical confirms have been pulled an assembled into a binder, which I have in my office unless someone needs these copies.  It is my understanding that Marcus Nettelton has the Power Confirmations in his office.

Please call with any questions.
