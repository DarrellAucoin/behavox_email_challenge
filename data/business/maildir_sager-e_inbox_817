Sager is apparently coming down right now to talk to Bill on this and other matters.  Mar.  31, 2001 expiration language is currently in Section 17, should this be shifted to shorter, 3 mo. timeframe? .  No CSA is contemplated to be put in place under this arrangement.  Even simply for completing execution of this document, in addition to enforcability questions, it seems preferable to leave European entities off, if possible.   --David

just a couple of things:

europe and ees entities are ok to include
take New Power out!!
We will not agree to Section 8 - Financial Responsibility - delete in its entirety
bill indicated that elizabeth had some language that baiscally would make the agreement expire 3 months after execution. could you please check with her and include?
have we started negotiating the CSA to the agreement?  I did not have a copy.

Thanks!!!
