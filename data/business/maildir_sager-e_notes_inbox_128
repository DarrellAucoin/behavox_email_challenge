Hi folks.  Marcus Wood recently contacted my about billing matters, and told 
me that Trading has double paid two bills - one in the amount of $9,305.50 
for "ENA, West Desk Trading", and in the amount of $52,674.90 for "ENA, 
California Power Matters" (perhaps this one is actually Sanders related??).  
Could one of you please contact Marcus and let him know if you want the 
amounts refunded or applied to any particular unpaid matters?  Thanks.
