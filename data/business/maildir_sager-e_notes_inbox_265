Subject: Review Procedure for Power Contracts

Effective today, there is a new legal review procedure for physical power 
contracts that are individually negotiated, with a term longer than one 
year.  Please notify me (Janette will maintain a list of contracts, 
counterparties and status) when drafting starts on such power contracts and 
provide me with a draft with sufficient time to make comments prior to 
closing.  My objective is to insure a consistent approach on these power 
contracts.  Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.  Please forward this 
memo on to the lawyers on your team.
