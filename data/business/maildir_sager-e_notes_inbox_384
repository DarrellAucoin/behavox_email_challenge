Would the drafting commitee and representative credit managers be interested 
in meeting in New York City on December 14 to discuss credit annex draft.  
Bill McCoy is giving a brown bag discussion on trading documentation at a law 
firm in NYC and perhaps we could meet with him afterwards?  Let me know asap 
and I'll ask Marving Goldstein, a partner at the firm, if we can meet after 
the brown bag.  Of course, that depends on Bill's availability too.
