Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within
are forced or rescheduled outages. Your
daily delivery will still contain these outages.

In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is
formatted like your daily deliveries you receive
nightly. This will enable you to load the data into your regular
database. Any questions please let me know.
Thanks.
