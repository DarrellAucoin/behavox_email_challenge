Dear Power Outage Database Customer,

Attached you will find an excel document. The outages contained within
are forced or
rescheduled outages. Your daily delivery will still contain
these outages.

In addition to the two excel documents, there is a dbf file that is
formatted like
your daily deliveries you receive nightly. This will enable
you to load the data into your regular database. Any questions please
let me know.
Thanks.
