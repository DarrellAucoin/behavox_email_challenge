I've entered the following deals per the lending agreement with El Paso. We'll be short 50 mw at Palo tomorrow, and this energy will need to be procured in the hour-ahead market. Please adjust our purchase from El Paso (699933) to a price of $4 after purchasing energy elsewhere, or to the appropriate price plus $4 if you purchase from El Paso. Thank you for your careful attention to this process.....

699933 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 PV/HLH
	 25 MW @ $60

699942 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 PV/HLH
	 25 MW @ $60

699944 - STSW buys EPE
	 PV/HLH
	 25 MW @ $60

If you have questions, ask me, and I'll give you answers.

Thanks,
Kate

Group,

We are short 50 mws for tomorrow at PV through lending with EPE.  25 mws will be under ST-SW, 25 mws will be under ST-WBOM.

We are also short 65 mws for tomorrow at SP-15.  25 mws will be under ST-WBOM, 40 mws will be under ST-CALI.

Both schedules are HE 7-22.  All deals should be under appropriate books.  Please take extra time with the EPE lending.  We would like to do this size throughout August and want to make sure they have no problems.  Details regarding prices and deal numbers will be coming from Kate.

Thanks,
Bill
