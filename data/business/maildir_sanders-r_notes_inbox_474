For better or for worse, I am the person that you should direct people to if 
things escalate.  However, I will be out of the office next week.  In my 
absence, have people call Richard Sanders.

Thanks.

One question that I want to be clear on is our response to someone who 
complains...  I know you told me that we should simply say its our policy, 
but undoubtedly, they are going to escalate.  Who do we point them to at that 
point?
