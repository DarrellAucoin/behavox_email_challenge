Jerry, regarding the station #8 outage request #37 on outage report dated 01-17-2002.  We requested an outage to block in the mainline at  station 8 to replace a leaking scrubber valve.  After further research we found that we can change this valve without blocking in the main line.  Therefore that outage request may be eliminated.
Thanks
Mick  Becker
Station#8
