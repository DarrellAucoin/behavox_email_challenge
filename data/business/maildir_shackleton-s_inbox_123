Thanks.  I'm sure Lavo will put them at the top of the priority list.

Just received a call from Virginia Loebel (609-936-8057) for a return of the $100,000 cash collateral (Independent Amount) we are holding.  She is sending a request which I will forward.  She says all trades have rolled off the books.
