Bill and Ed:
On 12/21, we received a letter from Entergy-Koch stating that their calculation of the Final Settlement Amount under the Master Netting Agreement results in a payment from them to Enron of $10,384,673.  They are awaiting payment instructions.

Can we verify this amount?

Lisa,

If we are okay with this amount, can they pay it to us without getting E&*Y's approval?
