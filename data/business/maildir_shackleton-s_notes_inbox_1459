I have always believed that Vitol SA and Vitol SA Inc are one and the same 
company anyway. IE the later is simply a US branch.

Okay.  I will inform the ENA commercial team that they will need to allocate 
the total available line with ECTRIC.  I believe separate masters with 
separate credit thresholds will be required.  Though I would appreciate input 
from legal if we can somehow net Vitol S.A. (Swiss) with its US unit, Vitol 
S.A. Inc. under one master and thus set only one, global limit without the 
need to allocate.

Yes, we have received figures for end 12/99 plus unaudited figs for 31/5/00. 
I believe Neil is doing the analysis and will input them into CAS - credit  
Analysis shortly.
