Sara et al.,

As part of the Sutton Bridge unwind, Trena has executed a foreign exchange 
deal with the parent company--European Power Holdings.  Is the attached form 
of confirmation acceptable to that counterparty?  Also, is Maroon Aboudy the 
appropriate person to send the confirm to, or should it be someone else?  
Thank you.
