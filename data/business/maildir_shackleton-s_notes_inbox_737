Regarding the H1250 swaps that are to be written today, please note that the 
swap group will not be reviewing the underlying asset for confidentiality or 
securities issues etc.  It was my understanding that the swap will be struck 
after TNPC goes public, but at what juncture of Enron's ownership may be hard 
to tell.  In any event, I presume your group is analyzing all these matters 
with Ron Astin.  Mary
