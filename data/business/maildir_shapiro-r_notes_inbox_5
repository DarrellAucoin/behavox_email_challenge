Re: ???????Enhancing the Leadership 

Rick, 

I have prepared the attached as possibly helpful to "enhancing the  
leadership." 

I am sorry this was so long in coming - I dropped the ball on this before I  
took vacation ?- then discovered my error when I returned. 

I'll call to follow up. 

Thanks.
