Some questions in advance of the 42nd floor meeting on the 16th:

Do you expect  the current crisis in California will result in an "overbuilt" situation for the pipelines serving California, similar to 1993-94?
It seems like everyone has an expansion proposal.

Do you expect the situation in India to be resolved to our satisfaction?


What is your projection for year-end stock price?
