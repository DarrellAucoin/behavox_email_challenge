Questar appears to not have updated their data since 05/23/2001...files we scraped over this weekend contain no data after that date...
 
Overthrust appears to have had problems with their site this weekend.  All cycles failed this weekend.
 
Transcolorado Deliveries / Kinder Morgan Segments Cycle 4 also had some issues this weekend...those jobs have been reset as well.
 
I have reset all of the above jobs, but we may need to look into recovering data for the lost days.
