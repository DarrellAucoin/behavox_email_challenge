Tim:

I got invited to an IEP strategy session time and place noted above.  I think it will give us an important opportunity to get IEP focued on our issues, including RTO formation, repairs to the CAISO, etc.  (I doubt I will get any more of a detailed agenda for a while.) I also think this will be an opportunity to get IEP focused on Westwide issues, or let them know we'll be using someone else for such broader issues.

I am comfortable having I or someone else from GA  go but I wanted to give you the option to go too.  The other people they are inviting include both senior regulatory or commerical people including:
Mr. Lynn Lednicky, Dynegy
Bill Hall, Duke
Jim Macias, Calpine
_____ Auclair
several others

  Please let me know by Monday your interest in going.  

Cheers,

Alan
