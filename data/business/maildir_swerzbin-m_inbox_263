Mike -

Both the options and the restricted stock vest 33.33% 1st, 2nd, and 3rd anniversary from grant date with a 5 year term.

Also, I have requested the change to your agreement on the retention payments.  Tim asked me to change the payment dates to the following:

4/1/02
4/1/03
4/1/04

He did not want to add any more to the signing payment per a conversation that he had with Lavo.  I hope this works for you.

Let me know if you need any more information!  

Amy
