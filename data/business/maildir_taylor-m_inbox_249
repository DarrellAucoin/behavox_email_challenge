As you both know, we are working on the launch of Phase III of EnronOnline. Since we will be making changes to the website we are currently reviewing all content online. This is an opportune time to make any necessary changes. I have attached the Legal and Privacy section for your review. If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,
Lindsay
