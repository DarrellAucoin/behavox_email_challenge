Subject: PLI Conference - Powerpoint
X-FileName: MTAYLO1 (Non-Privileged).pst

Attached is a power point I used for next Tuesday's PLI presentation.
In addition to my own input, I borrowed from Ken's outline and Mark's
powerpoint from last year - and so I thought I'd give us all credit on
page 1.  Please feel free to make any changes or additions as you feel
appropriate.  I will be out of the office on Friday and Monday, and so
if you wish to discuss the presentation with me beforehand, it will be
best if we speak by Thursday.  Bill.
