Mary,

I have been working on a clearing initiative for EnronOnline in the past two months. Under the current structure Enron would give its counterparties an option to clear the transactions though VMAC at a fee on a trade to trade basis, so that the trades are guaranteed by a credit wrap up supplied by a third party insurance company (FSA). Please see the appended document for a description of the clearing solution.

I am aware from information from the credit group and the global finance group about the "master netting initiative" that you are leading. I would like to seat with you to discuss where our initiatives might overlap each other and where they might complement each other.

Appended are the documents that describe the initiative at a high level.
