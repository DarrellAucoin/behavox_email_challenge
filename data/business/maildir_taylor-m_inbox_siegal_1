Ah, but it does.  If you strip out the actual data from the database, i.e., not run a specific report, some of the new projects actually have negative MW capacity, they are decomissionings.

P.S. I was talking to Trevor about the ZEVs in Cali, what's the story?

Adam,

Newgen doesn't have closures.  I was going to try power.dat.  Do you have any other suggestions?

Thanks
Mike

I did, it's on powerMap and on the web on the EPA's "Airs" site.

The cool thing to do is combine that map from Powermap with the proposed plants and closures from the Newgen database. Newgen is on the RDI web site.  Gives you an idea of supply and demand for ERC's. Give me a buzz if you have any questions.

Adam,

I saw a map of non-attainment areas.  Trevor said you may have complied it.  Where was your source of non-attainment areas?

Thanks,
