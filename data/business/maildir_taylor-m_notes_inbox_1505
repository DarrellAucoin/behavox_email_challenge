I am currently working on a new ISDA wherein the counterparty is a US sub of 
a foreign Guarantor.  Upon consulting with Rhett Jackson in Tax, he thought 
we needed to work a form of the tax reps into the guaranty since the 
Guarantor was foreign.  I see the same issue arising in respect of certain 
other amendments on which I am working.  Rhett is looking over this matter 
now and I will advise.    Any thoughts?
