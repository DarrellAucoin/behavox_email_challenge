In looking the captioned doc over, I noted the fees involved are based solely 
on MMBTUs.  Since Canada is now engaging in power transactions (and already 
using some ENA ISDAs), should this agreement's fee schedule be amended to 
reflect a power price too?  If you agree, I will coordinate.  Who handles 
this matter in tax, Rhett Jackson?  Mary
