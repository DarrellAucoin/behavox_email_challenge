Susan/Doug -

Below are updated versions of the ESA and Password Application.  Once the ESA 
was revised, I looked at the Password App. and realized we still had language 
in it relating to making offers and buy/sell transactions - somewhat 
inconsistent with the CL modules.

Please look over the attached and let me know if you should have any comments 
or questions.
