Our liability should be limited to recoveries from the insurances required in the contract and specifically purchased for work under this contract. If covered by the policy, we will respond.  Losses, costs and expenses not recovered from the insurance, shall remain the obligation of Citizens. 

Once again, if they agree to the limitation, the continued concerns would be:
1. The indemnity would be set aside by a court.
2. The indemnity from Citizens does not hold or they are financially unable to respond.

Please advise if there are further questions.

Please review the attached proposed compromise to be sent to Citizens following internal review.  Lou worked with Don and myself to draft this document.  Jim and Chris, your comments are appreciated.  My apologies for the short turn around time, however, we need to get back to Citizens as quickly as possible due to the plant going commercial sometime between 6/18 and 6/21.
