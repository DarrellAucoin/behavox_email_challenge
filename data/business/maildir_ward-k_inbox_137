Kim,

The City of Mesa is in receipt of your email confirming Enron's lack of gas
scheduling for Mesa for December 6, 2001.  Based on that email of December
5, 2001, Mesa must find an alternate gas supplier in order to meet Mesa's
present and future gas needs.  Thank you for your assistance.

Cliff
