All, 

Attached, for your information,  is a 2 page financial and statistical fact sheet for EGM (as a consolidated unit and for each business unit).  I obviously would have liked our gross margin and EBIT to be a lot larger but all the other facts show enormous growth and progress.   I wanted to at least get it into your hands in case you needed a quick reference.

Thanks,
Mike
