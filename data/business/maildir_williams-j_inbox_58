Subject: May 1st cut for Peoples Gas
X-FileName: Williams, Jason (Trading).pst

Jason,
	Cora and Irene told me the Enron delivery to Peoples Gas for gas day
May 1st will be cut by 21 MMBtu.  Peoples will reduce the SIQ purchase of
125,000 by 21 leaving an SIQ amount of 124,979.

Apparently, the reduction is due to confirmation problems on Northern
Border.
