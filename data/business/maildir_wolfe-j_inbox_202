Subject: Meeting today at 3:00
X-FileName: JWOLFE (Non-Privileged).pst

We will meet for thirty minutes before our 3:30 fundies meeting.  

1.  EOL market making - Lavo has asked us to increase basis liquidity.  Janie has mentioned general theme of market, "why trade on EOL 5000/d and risk moving the market".  We are becoming market framers.  I think Frank Ermis is a pioneer.

2.  Deal confirmations - Anne Bike misbooked a deal for me from March, cost $3.5 million.  How do we deal with this issue of confirmations missing deals.

3.  Vacation and work hours - Discuss vacation schedules for the rest of the year.  We need to do a good job of coordinating when we are out.

Mike
