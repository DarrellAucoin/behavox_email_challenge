Victor,

As discussed, we need to engineer a tie-in to Peerless so that we have a way to periodically turnover (by selling) our fuel oil inventory to before it goes bad.

James McMillan will forward to you a scope of work and cost for an engineer to go to site to develop the tie-in design.  This cost should be between $5 and 10K.

Once finalized, please issue an Eco PO to perform this work.

Rick
