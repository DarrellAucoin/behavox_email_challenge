You got a notice from Hollywood Video saying you owe $64.99 for a DVD you
borrowed on 11/30/01 entitled "15 minutes".  You are to enclose the  letter
when paying your bill so I am mailing it to you.  Be sure to look for it in
the mail.

Also, we need to talk about the weekend of 01/12.  My doctor's appointment
has been changed.  Let's talk about it.

Sorry I forgot you went to Belize.  Hope you had a wonderful time.  Hope
there weren't any bugs in that thatched roof!  Love you, Mom
