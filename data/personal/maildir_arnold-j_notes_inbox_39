Dear Mr.. Lavorato,

The $1500 that you sent to us in October, has not been credited to our
account.If those funds were sent through AM TRADE INTERNATIONAL, you need to
have your bank send an amendment message stating that the respective funds
are intended for final credit to World Sports Exchange/ ACCT # 12307915.

Most likely, those funds are sitting at the Antigua Overseas Bank.

2. Another suggestion would be to call back those funds since the
beneficiary is not in receipt of payment, and resend it through the new
instruction as per our website.This method is guaranteed more efficient.

For any further questions, please call the accounts department at WSEX.

REGARDS
MARIA.
Accounts Manager
