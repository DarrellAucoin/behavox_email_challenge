Hi  Lynn,
 
Hadn't had a chance  to touch base with you since all of the Enron problems.  Wanted to let you  know how badly I feel for everything that has happened.  Enron is too fine  a company to have something like this happen.  You have so many great  employees in the organization.  Many, like yourself, I consider to be not  only business associates, but friends.
 
I just wanted to  send a quick note expressing my sorrow for all the stress you and others are  having to endure.  We support you 100%.  Things will get better.   
 
Hopefully, you can  find some joy in the upcoming holiday season.
 
Sincerely,
Bill
