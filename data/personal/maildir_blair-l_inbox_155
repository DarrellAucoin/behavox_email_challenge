Jean,
 
I am in Almaty.  It looks like a winter wonderland -- something out of Dr. Zhivago.  
 
I can''t get my laptop to connect - so I am using the hotel computer.
 
Please advise my team and Ricki to send messages to compuserve address cormanerb@cs.com <mailto:cormanerb@cs.com> as it is much easier/faster to access than Enron mailman.  Also could you ask Lynn to temporarily have me removed from all the gas logistics daily phone and email update/weekend update messages.
