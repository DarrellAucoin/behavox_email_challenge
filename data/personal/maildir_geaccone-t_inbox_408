No problem. I love you too. Let me know what time you are leaving today. If you wanted, we could ride together and leave your car (or mine) here. Or, if it's easier, we can just leave according to our own schedule. I thought I would leave by about 5pm.

When I checked the schedules last week they were ok. Sorry about that.  

Love you
