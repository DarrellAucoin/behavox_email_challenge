Is that like "Most Favored Nation" status?  If so, don't I already have that?

I'm glad to hear that someone from Credit it showing up!  I heard we weren't 
going to have a good turnout from you guys, so I expect those that do attend 
will achieve "favored Credit person" status.

I was saving my energy for Marie's party tonight.   You know how ice cream 
takes it out of you.
