X-FileName: TLOKEY (Non-Privileged).pst

Three cheers for our neighbor, Brad Odom, who has successfully negotiated the removal of the 18,000 sofas and other junk that had piled up next to the building at the corner of Hopkins and Fairview!
 
This Saturday morning, Brad, and volunteers (anyone who wants to help - bring your shovel and come along) will be landscaping the area, with funds donated by the owner of the property.  The landscaping is being done in an effort to discourage future dumpings in this spot.
 
Over and above the call of duty - these are East Montrose residents!
