I second the emotion of the chica de las labias rosas famosas!

And, to paraphrase Cat Stevens' - 

Saturday mornin' I'm feelin' bad 
But it's worth it for the time that I had 

Rage on!

  Thank you for a great time!  We enjoyed ourselves so much, it was an absolute 
  treat!

  I love our little barrio!  It's the absolute best in town.  John & I 
  appreciate being invited to all the fabulous festivities this season (I mean 
  it, Richard) & we hope to one day return the cheer. 

  Feliz Navidad y Prospero Ano Nuevo, Queridos Amigos!

  and William.....Que te cresca el _ _ _ _ !
