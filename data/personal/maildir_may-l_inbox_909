Larry,
    Given your background and association with the Naval Reserve, I would
recommend that as your quickest route to intelligence analysis.  However, do
not limit yourself to DIA and NSA.  Go on-line to www.firstgov.org   and
look at all of the US intelligence community employment opportunities,
including the FBI , CIA, and Treasury, et al.  Your language skills and
foreign travel will be especially valuable.

    I would be pleased to advise you as you pursue a career change.
Cheers/JWL

Dear Dr. Lucas,

I am a part-time student at American Military University in the MA
program in Intelligence Studies.  Currently, I am enrolled in Dr.
Lockwood's Analytic Methods course.  I have been planning to finish my
MA (I have an MBA from the University of Washington as well) in three
years and then begin a second career in intelligence analysis (I am
currently an Energy commodities trader with Enron Corp in Houston,
Texas).  However, with the events on Sept. 11, I wish to apply now for a
position.  If it is convenient,  I would like to discuss career
opportunities in government service with you.  Attached are the cover
letter and resume I have already sent the DIA and NSA.  Given the events
of the last two weeks,  I know you must be extremely busy and appreciate
any time you may spare.

Sincerely,


Lawrence J. May
