Ken Logsdon, Don Bosse, David Raack and My Self wanted to wish you and your family a very safe and enjoyable Thanksgiving.

For your convenience, I wanted to give the Market Hours for the rest of the week. Today and Wednesday, regular hours-8:30 am-3:00 pm (central), on Thursday the markets are closed. Friday the NYSE and other markets closed at Noon and our office will officially be closed at 1:00 pm.

Once again, Have a very enjoyable Thanksgiving with your loved ones and please give us a call with any questions.

Take Care,

Take
