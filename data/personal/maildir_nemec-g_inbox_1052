we are leaving for Estes tomorrow and will not be back until the following
Sunday.  You can call Will's cell 214 478-2066 if you need us or call the
Snyder's in Estes.  I am doing fine.  The baby is kicking and ready to cool
off in Colorado.  I will chat with you when we get back.  We love you guys.
