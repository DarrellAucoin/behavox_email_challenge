Jeff:

It was great catching up with you yesterday.  I wish we had the time to do
it more often.

Here is Albert and Frances Paley's information:

Albert Paley Studio
25 N. Washington
Rochester, New York 14614

716-232-5260 (studio)
716-461-5087 (home)

I do not have an email for them.

It also ocurred to me that you should try to come to our next Design Council
meeting (March 12th at 6:30 p.m.)  The meeting is a tour of Gail and Louis
Adler's collection.  Not only do they have amazing contemporary art but they
have a number of pieces by Paley including a fireplace surround that they
commissioned.  It might give you some ideas for your own project.

Their address is:

3680 Inwood Drive
Houston, Texas 77019

I hope to see you there.  Please let me know if I can do anything else.

Cindi
