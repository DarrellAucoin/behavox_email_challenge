Thanks for the time yesterday.  I wanted also to tell you about this recurring dream I've had (3 times now).  Your buddy Lee Raymond's company bought Enron, you both become co-CEO (money on you), and our mgmt team gets to apply our way of business to ExxonMobil, and unbelievable wealth and shareholder value is created.  Odds?

Jeff
