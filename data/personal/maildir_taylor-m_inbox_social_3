We are planning to have the fantasy draft on Wednesday at 7:30 (or whenever=
 Kris yells out "Let's Do This") at my apartment (Archstone Memorial Height=
s #2017).  The website is established and you can check it out and change y=
our information (link at bottom).  Use this link to establish a username an=
d id, then you can logon on from nfl.com and choosing fantasy.  Members hav=
e expressed an interest in learning their draft position before draft day, =
so we are planning on drawing for draft placement at 8:00 tonite at my apt.=
 or at 10:00 tonite at the Marquee (depending on your response).  You do no=
t need to be present, but are invited to either attend or participate via p=
hone, internet.  Draft night will be BYOB, and when ya'll see the caliber t=
eam that I will be fielding, you will want to drink heavily.  The $50 leagu=
e fee is due by the start of Week 3, penalizable with a loss untill it is p=
aid.  To entice early payment, a 10% discount will be offered to anyone who=
 pays on draft night.  Email or call me with any questions/concerns/advice =
about the league.
