Hi Paul,
Finally drug your file out to the basement.  I have attached several
different options in the Excel file below.  Keep in mind that about 5 weeks
after closing you will receive a check from your current lender for the
existing escrow account.  You can either pocket that money or "reimburse"
your out put from this closing.  Let me know if you need further
clarification on this or any of the options.  I've attached the application
and forms I need for processing.  I have survey, dec page and mortgage info
already mostly need updated W2, paystubs and banking info.

I didn't speak with your coworker yesterday unless I'm really losing it.
Ask him to give me a call anytime or give me his name and I'll give him a
call.  Thanks so much for calling and I look forward to helping you save
some money.
