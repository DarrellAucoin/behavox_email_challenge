Greg, how big was that last check you told me to watch for. I will transfer 
the remaining to the LIR. QQQ improved for your short today to close at 68 
47/64. Nothing good out of CA utilities and power. Nat Gas lower today. I 
will watch tonight the new President and the vanquished. Also, will today's 
announcement about ENE effect you? Ben
