Seems to be a consensus among those of you I heard from that Jaliscience is
the place to be tonight. If there are people who think this idea sucks, I am
more than willing to alter plans. But, as of now, we'll meet up at
Jaliscience about 9:00. I'll call Clay when I get into town, so he can be
the go to guy for questions, etc. You're welcome Clay. See you tonight.
